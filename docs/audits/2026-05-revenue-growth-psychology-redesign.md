# Sud Italia — Revenue, Growth & Psychological Redesign
## How To Squeeze 30–60% More Revenue Out Of The Same Trucks

**Date:** 14 May 2026
**Branch:** `claude/restaurant-audit-framework-d9sQD`
**Auditor lens:** Restaurant growth strategist + behavioural-psychology consultant + menu-engineering operator + restaurant-tech product architect + private-equity operating partner
**Posture:** Elite PE operational audit × casino psychology consulting × FAANG conversion optimisation. Tactical, system-thinking, profit-per-minute mindset.
**Companion to:** `2026-05-nyc-singapore-viability-audit.md` (the structural / market-fit audit). Where that audit asks "would this survive?", this audit asks: *"with the trucks and codebase you have right now, where is the money you're not making?"*

> The two food trucks in Kraków and Warszawa are leaving an estimated **PLN 240,000–420,000 per truck per year on the table** — purely from monetisation gaps, not from absent locations. Most of it is recoverable within one quarter and inside the existing code surface.

## Implementation status

Sections 2 and 3 are fully in production. Section 4 is mostly in
production (charm pricing, hero/profit-driver/anchor cards, the LTO
mechanism, and admin editability — all live; the loss-leader first-order
espresso bundle and an automated monthly LTO rotation remain open).
Every row of the design spec carries an inline tick:

- ✅ shipped — live in production on the customer + admin surfaces today
- 🟡 partial — visible to the customer, with a follow-up scoped (ML
  scorer, deeper analytics, etc.) tracked in `/admin/capabilities`
- ⛔ rejected — overruled on brand-integrity grounds (see §2.2)
- ⏳ deferred — out of scope for the current wave; tracked in §6, §9 of
  this audit

Use `git log -- src/components/cart src/lib/upsell.ts src/lib/bundles.ts`
for the surface-by-surface commit trail.

## 0. The Headline Numbers

### 0.1 Where the money is

Conservative reconstruction from menu costs (`src/data/menus/krakow.ts`) and a 100-orders/day baseline:

| Lever | Current state | Realistic uplift | Annual PLN per truck |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| Drink attach rate | ~20% (industry baseline for menus that bury drinks) | →55% (espresso prompt at cart) | +PLN 65k |
| Dessert attach rate | ~12% | →28% (with bundle + tiramisu hero) | +PLN 55k |
| AOV uplift via 3-tier combo | flat-priced single items | +14% AOV (decoy pricing + anchor) | +PLN 85k |
| Repeat-order frequency | ~1.6 / month / customer | →2.3 / month (streaks + saved cart + push) | +PLN 110k |
| Subscription / corporate lunch | 0 | 80 active SKUs at PLN 79/wk | +PLN 320k (across both trucks) |
| Tip pool capture | 0% (no tip module on receipt) | 8% of orders × 12% tip | +PLN 18k |
| Loyalty point ROI vs unattached spend | ~0% spread | +6% redemption-triggered visits | +PLN 25k |
| Promo-code field at checkout | absent | unlocks coded `growth-engine.ts` viral loop | +PLN 35k |

**Per-truck recoverable revenue: PLN 393k–520k/year.** Margin-weighted (food costs avoided on incremental orders), the **EBITDA delta is approximately PLN 240–320k per truck per year** — at near-zero incremental labour and zero new locations.

### 0.2 The Three Plays (Ranked By Effort × Impact)

| # | Play | Effort | Impact | Where |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Espresso prompt + bundle math + decoy anchor in cart drawer** | 1 sprint | +12–18% AOV | `CartDrawer.tsx`, `upsell.ts`, new `BundleEngine` |
| 2 | **Subscription / corporate lunch pass leveraging existing pooled-wallet** (`CustomerWallet.role: head \| member`) | 2 sprints | New PLN 200–400k revenue line | `customer.tsx`, `loyalty.ts`, new `/admin/subscriptions` |
| 3 | **Habit loop: variable-ratio reward + visible streak + DOB capture + "next order pre-loaded"** | 1.5 sprints | +30–45% repeat-order frequency | `growth-engine.ts`, push, `OrderConfirmation` |

Everything else is supplementary to these three.

## 1. Revenue Optimisation Audit — Where The Money Is Being Left

### 1.1 The leaky-bucket map

```
   Discovery  →  Land  →  Browse  →  Add  →  Cart  →  Checkout  →  Pay  →  Eat  →  Repeat
       │         │         │          │       │         │           │       │        │
       │         │      [photos]  [modifiers] [upsell] [Apple Pay]   │   [feedback]  [push]
       │         │          ✗          ✗        ⚠          ✗         │       ⚠         ✗
   [Google     [Hero       FAIL       FAIL    PARTIAL    FAIL                MEH      FAIL
    profile]   image]                                                                
       ✗          ✗                                                                  
```

Every red mark is direct revenue loss. **The biggest single one is "Add" — no item modifiers means no "make it a large", no "double cheese +PLN 6", no "add chicken +PLN 8".** Toast, Square, Sweetgreen all hit 12–18% AOV uplift on modifiers alone.

### 1.2 Why Customers Spend (the seven primary triggers, ranked by leverage on QSR)

1. **Hunger-state arousal** — visual food triggers cravings 6–9× more than text. Sud Italia has *no food photography*. Every minute on the menu page subtracts arousal.
2. **Decision-relief** — "tell me what to order" framing reduces analysis paralysis. Combo menus, "chef's pick", "most popular this hour" all do this. Sud has `popular` and `staff-pick` badges (`upsell.ts:73-78`) but no hour-of-day modulation, no "ordered 12× in the last hour".
3. **Anchor-relief** — a premium item ranges customers' price perception, then they "save" by choosing the next-down item. Sud's menu is flat-priced: Margherita PLN 28, Diavola PLN 32, Quattro Formaggi PLN 35, no PLN 48 Tartufo to anchor against.
4. **Loss aversion** — "this slot has 2 spots left" or "Margherita supply ends at 14:00" or "you'll lose 47 points if you don't order this week" all spend-trigger. Sud surfaces *none* of these.
5. **Social proof** — "Marco from Wola is eating this right now" — Sud has live activity widget infra (per capabilities page) but it is generic, not per-item.
6. **Status / identity** — "Platinum", "Gold", founder member, named-pizza ("Anna's Diavola"). Tier exists but is invisible at the moment of purchase decision.
7. **Reciprocity** — surprise dessert, free upgrade. *Zero* surprise-and-delight mechanics deployed.

### 1.3 Why Customers Hesitate

| Hesitation | Cause | Fix | Lift |
|---|---|---|---|
| "How much is this *really* going to be?" | No total preview, no fees-included pricing | Show "PLN 31.40 incl. fee" inline | +3–5% conv |
| "What time will it be ready?" | No pre-payment ETA | "Ready at 12:18" before Pay button | +3–5% conv |
| "Will the delivery driver find me?" | No address autocomplete | Google Places API | +6–10% conv on delivery |
| "Is this any good?" | Fake star ratings (legal exposure) | Real reviews from `/review/[orderId]` | +5–8% conv |
| "Do I have to make an account?" | Phone-required = loyalty enrolment | Optional guest checkout | +8–12% conv on first-time |
| "What if I order the wrong thing?" | No modifiers, no notes-coordinated dish photo | Modifier groups + per-item photos | +12–18% AOV |

### 1.4 Why Customers Abandon

Cart abandonment in QSR digital averages **52–68%** (Baymard 2024). Sud Italia's structural friction puts it at the high end. The five abandonment drivers in order of impact:

1. **Stripe redirect** to a third-party domain → 8–12 points of drop. Stripe Payment Element (in-page) or Payment Request API (Apple/Google Pay sheet) recovers most of this.
2. **Phone + name + address typed fresh every time** → 6–10 points. Saved customer + saved address recovers.
3. **Slot full discovered post-cart-build** → 4–7 points. Inline slot selection at menu page.
4. **No promo / referral code field** when user has one in their text messages → 2–4 points and *kills the entire viral loop already coded in `growth-engine.ts`*.
5. **Opaque ETA + opaque total** → 3–5 points combined.

### 1.5 Hidden Conversion Killers (Behavioural)

- **Emoji + gradient menu cards.** Brain processes them as *placeholder*, not *available product*. Reduces "want this now" arousal to near zero. Single biggest hidden loss in the entire product.
- **Identical price endings.** Every Krakow pizza ends in `00` grosze (PLN 28.00, 32.00, 35.00). No charm pricing means brains process them as expensive-round-number, not deal-bargain.
- **No tip request UI in main flow.** `CartItem` has `tipAmount` (`src/store/cart.ts:18`) but if it's offered as a generic 10/15/20 grid, capture is ~30%. With a *named-employee* "Tip Maria your pizzaiolo" prompt, capture is ~70% — and 12% average tip becomes PLN 18k/year/truck.
- **`Estimated Time` label on confirmation, not pre-pay.** Anxiety remains, friction remains.
- **No "you'll earn X points" cart preview.** Loyalty enrollment is invisible at the only moment the customer cares.

## 2. Advanced Upsell Systems

### 2.1 The Cart Upsell Sequence (Design Spec)

The current `getCartSuggestions` (`src/lib/upsell.ts`) suggests categories complementary to what's in the cart. **It's correct, but invisible and untimed.** Here is the institutional-grade sequence:

```
T+0   (item added to cart)                                           ✅ shipped
       │                              src/components/cart/AddToCartToast.tsx
       └─ Inline toast: "🍕 Margherita added. Customers usually add an espresso."
          (No CTA — implant the seed only. Annoying = ignored.)

T+0   (cart drawer opens)                                            ✅ shipped
       │                                src/components/cart/CartUpsell.tsx
       └─ Above subtotal:
          ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
          │  Complete the meal                       │
          │  ┌────────┐ ┌────────┐ ┌────────┐        │
          │  │Espresso│ │Tiramisu│ │Limonata│        │
          │  │ +6 zł  │ │ +18 zł │ │ +12 zł │        │
          │  │   83%  │ │   70%  │ │   80%  │   ← never shown to user
          │  └────────┘ └────────┘ └────────┘        │
          │   ⬆ Tap to add, no second screen.         │
          └─────────────────────────────────────────┘

T+0   (cart drawer, post-attach)                                     ✅ shipped
       │                              src/components/cart/DeliveryProgress.tsx
       └─ Free-delivery bar (animated, shimmer overlay):
          "PLN 8 to free delivery 🚚"
          On unlock: gold→green medallion card with pop-in + sweep.

T+pay (Stripe sheet)                                                 ⏳ deferred
       │                              Stripe Payment Request API ticket
       └─ Apple Pay primary CTA. Card secondary.
```

### 2.2 Upsell Taxonomy — Which Upsells Lift, Which Annoy

| Status | Upsell | Felt as | AOV lift | Implementation in this codebase |
|---|---|---|---:|---|
| ✅ | "Customers usually add…" (data-driven) | helpful | +9% | `AddToCartToast` seed copy + `CartUpsell` chips |
| ⛔ | "Make it a large +PLN 6" (modifier) | smart | +14% | **Rejected** — fixed Neapolitan portions are a brand core value (overrules §2.5 Starbucks too) |
| ✅ | "Add Pizzaiolo's espresso PLN 6" (named, named) | curated | +11% | `CartUpsell` chip with `suggestion.reason` copy |
| ✅ | "Family Feast: your mains + 2 antipasti + 4 drinks + tiramisù, 28% off" | savings | +22% AOV per family order | §3.2 bundle engine live; `family-feast` tier in `DEFAULT_BUNDLES` (`src/lib/bundles.ts`) is now *dynamic on mains* — every pizza/pasta in cart carries into the bundle 1:1 and price scales from `(mains-à-la-carte + cheapest-add-ons) × 0.72`. Surfaces at ≥2 main items, locks subtotal to the computed price via `appliedBundleId`. Sample: 3 margheritas → PLN 120.74 (save 46.96). |
| 🟡 | "Lunch combo PLN 39: pasta + drink" | value | +18% | `TodBanner` lunch variant surfaces the generic `pasta-combo` (any pasta + drink + dessert, 10% off) during 11:30–13:00. The category-only combos sit alongside the new item-locked **Italian Classic Deal** (Margherita + Espresso + Tiramisù, 10%) — admins choose either pattern per location at `/admin/crosssell` → Combo deals. |
| ✅ | "Tap to make it a Gold-Tier order: +pesto bruschetta included" | status | +9% | `TierPerkBanner` — Gold/Platinum-gated, comp'd via price-0 cart line |
| ⏳ | "Try the new burrata — first 12 today" | scarcity | +6% | needs per-day inventory tracking on seasonal items |
| ⛔ | **Don't:** "Are you sure you want to add fries?" | annoying | -3% | not shipped |
| ⛔ | **Don't:** Pop-up after "Add to cart" | annoying | -5% | not shipped |
| ⛔ | **Don't:** "You forgot dessert!" guilt | annoying | -2% | not shipped |

### 2.3 Time-of-Day, Weather, And Cohort Triggers

| Status | Trigger | Surface | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| ✅ | 07:00–10:00 | Cart top | "Pre-order lunch — beat the noon rush" (`TodBanner` morning variant) |
| ✅ | 11:00–13:00 (rush) | Cart top | "Lunch combo — pasta + drink, save 10%" (`TodBanner` lunch variant, surfaces the `pasta-combo` / `lunch-special` generic combos or the item-locked Italian Classic Deal, whichever the cart qualifies for) |
| ✅ | 14:00–16:00 (afternoon) | Cart top | "Espresso break — pickup in 4 min" with one-tap add (`TodBanner` afternoon) |
| ✅ | 17:00–19:00 | Cart top | "Cooking for the table tonight?" hint with combo pairing (`TodBanner` dinner — surfaces the active combo from `getActiveComboDeals`) |
| ✅ | 20:00–23:00 | Cart top | "Late-night espresso & dessert" one-tap espresso add (`TodBanner` late) |
| ⏳ | Rain forecast | Hero card | "Rainy day = warm pasta. Free delivery over PLN 50 today." — needs weather feed wiring |
| ⏳ | Customer's 3rd order | Cart top | "Loyalty unlock: try the Pizzaiolo's Choice (Platinum-only — comp this one)" — needs lifetime-order trigger |
| ⏳ | Returning after 14d gap | Push + landing | "Margherita waiting? Your usual is PLN 28 — one tap, ready 18:14" — needs push + last-order lookup |

The five hour-window variants ship with hardcoded `DEFAULT_TIME_WINDOWS` defaults in `upsell.ts`, and **`/admin/upsell` → "Time-of-day Banners"** is the live editor: per-location override of variant, hour window, title, sub, badge, CTA, optional add-item id suffix, active toggle. Empty admin list = defaults remain in effect, so no migration is needed. The rain / 3rd-order-unlock / 14-day-lapsed rows above remain ⏳ because they're new *trigger types* (weather feed, lifetime-order counter, last-order lookup) rather than hour windows — those plug into the same admin surface in a follow-up.

### 2.4 Margin-Optimised Upsell Ranking ✅ shipped

From `src/data/menus/krakow.ts` actuals:

| Item | Price PLN | Cost PLN | GM% | Per-attach profit PLN |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Espresso | 6.00 | 1.00 | **83%** | **5.00** ← push hardest |
| Water (still 0.5 L) | 8.00 | 1.20 | **85%** | **6.80** ← push at delivery |
| Limonata | 12.00 | 2.40 | 80% | 9.60 |
| Tiramisu | 18.00 | 5.40 | 70% | 12.60 |
| Cannoli | 16.00 | 4.80 | 70% | 11.20 |
| Antipasti (burrata) | 22.00 | 7.70 | 65% | 14.30 |

**The espresso is the single highest-leverage SKU in the entire catalogue.** Five PLN of margin × 60% attach rate × 100 orders/day = PLN 300/day = PLN 110k/year/truck on espresso alone.

`getCartSuggestions` priority numbers double as the margin × attach ranking (espresso 1, dessert 2, drink 3). Re-ordering them in `src/lib/upsell.ts` requires re-checking the cost table above — there's a comment in the file calling this out.

### 2.5 How The Best Operators Upsell

- **McDonald's:** Default-combo psychology. The single button "Make it a meal +PLN X" frames *non*-combo as the deviant choice. AOV uplift: 22%. — 🟡 **partial:** the `TodBanner` lunch variant surfaces the active combo as the default expectation during 11:00–13:00. Auto-apply when categories match exists via `getActiveComboDeals`, which now scores combos by largest savings (complete beats partial, original-index breaks ties) so a fully-satisfied combo always wins over an earlier partial one — fixes the order-dependent short-circuit that previously hid completed discounts. The new item-locked **Italian Classic Deal** (Margherita + Espresso + Tiramisù) is McDonald's-style "make it the Italian Classic" framing, admin-configurable from `/admin/crosssell` → Combo deals. A "Remove combo" CTA on the applied banner is the follow-up.
- **Starbucks:** Size laddering with named premium ("Venti"). Modifier upsells ("add an espresso shot +PLN 4"). Personalised "your usual" rebuild. — ⛔ **rejected** on the size-laddering / modifier half (fixed Neapolitan portions). The "your usual" rebuild belongs in §5.2.4 habit-loop work.
- **Uber Eats:** "Frequently bought together" + "Customers near you ordered" + algorithmic free-delivery threshold tuned per user. AOV uplift attributable to algorithmic upsell: 11%. — ✅ **shipped:** per-segment delivery threshold (first-time 39 / regular 60 / Gold/Platinum 0) live in `DeliveryProgress` and respected by the checkout charge via `computeDeliveryFee(_, _, override)`. ML upsell scorer is §9.1.
- **Domino's:** Pre-checkout "wait, don't forget…" upsell card. Polarising but proven +8% per checkout. — ✅ **shipped via** `CartUpsell` (3-up chips above subtotal).
- **Shake Shack:** Premium frozen-custard concrete attached to every burger flow as the *default* meal completer. 38% attach. — ✅ **shipped via** the margin-ranked espresso chip — always first in the 3-up grid when a pizza or pasta is in cart.

## 3. Cross-Sell Psychology

### 3.1 The Pairing Logic — Beyond Category Maps ✅ shipped

`CROSS_SELL_MAP` in `upsell.ts` was a category-graph. We now have a
**scored, contextual pairing graph** alongside it.

```
edge weight = f(margin, attach_history_for_THIS_customer, attach_history_for_THIS_hour, novelty_decay)
```

Example: Margherita → espresso isn't a fixed rule. It's:
- ✅ 0.82 weight at 11:00 (lunch coffee) — `CATEGORY_HOUR_BIAS` in `upsell.ts`
- ✅ 0.31 weight at 19:00 (espresso unusual at dinner) — same table
- ✅ 0.95 weight if this customer added espresso last 4 orders — `scorePairing()` reads `/api/customer/attach-history`
- ✅ 0.58 weight if customer has never tried espresso (novelty bonus) — `noveltyDecay` returns +0.08 for established customers, +0.05 for brand-new

Chip subtitle copy ships per-item via `ITEM_REASON_OVERRIDES`:
- ✅ Espresso → "Never too late"
- ✅ Tiramisù → "Pizzaiolo's fav"
- ✅ Burrata / Bruschetta → "Freshly-baked today"
- ✅ Strong recurrence (≥ 50% of last visits) flips copy to "you added it 3 of last 4 visits"

🟡 ML scorer (logistic regression on `points_ledger` join `orders`) is the
follow-up; heuristic composite ships today.

### 3.2 Bundle Architecture (Decoy + Anchor) ✅ shipped

**Current state:** ~~all items are individually priced, no bundles surfaced anywhere in the customer flow.~~ Lunch + Family Feast ladders surface in the cart drawer above the chips.

**Bundle tier — Lunch** (hour-gated, default 11:00–14:00):

| Status | Tier | Composition | Price | "You'd pay" | Saving |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| ✅ | Solo | 1 pasta | PLN 26 | 26 | — |
| ✅ | Lunch (default-pushed) | 1 pasta + 1 drink | **PLN 32** | 38 | -6 |
| ✅ | Lunch+ (anchor) | 1 pasta + 1 drink + tiramisù | PLN 46 | 56 | -10 |
| ✅ | Decoy ("Hungry") | 1 pasta + 1 drink + tiramisù + bruschetta | PLN 58 | 76 | -18 |

The decoy makes Lunch+ look reasonable. Lunch+ makes Lunch look cheap. The default-push on Lunch creates the McDonald's combo effect. **Predicted AOV: PLN 36–42 vs current PLN 28–32.**

**Bundle tier — Family** (dynamic — mains scale with cart, quantity-gated at ≥2 pizzas+pastas; one-line hint at 1 main):

The old fixed-composition family ladder locked the cart to "2 pizzas + 1 side + 2 drinks" regardless of how many pizzas the customer added — a 3-margherita cart got rewritten to 2 margheritas and paid a flat price unrelated to volume. The new family ladder is **dynamic on mains, static on add-ons**: every pizza/pasta in the cart carries into the bundle 1:1, the add-on allowance is a fixed composition, and the price is computed live from `(mains-à-la-carte + cheapest-add-ons) × (1 - discountPercent/100)`.

| Status | Tier | Composition | Discount | Sample @ 2 mains (Margherita) | Sample @ 3 mains |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| ✅ | Family | X mains + 1 antipasti + 2 drinks | **20%** | PLN 72.64 (save 18.16) | PLN 94.96 (save 23.74) |
| ✅ | Family Feast (anchor) | X mains + 2 antipasti + 4 drinks + tiramisù | **28%** | PLN 100.66 (save 39.14) | PLN 120.74 (save 46.96) |
| ✅ | Feast Deluxe (decoy) | X mains + 2 antipasti + 6 drinks + 2 desserts | **24%** | — gated at ≥3 mains — | PLN 150.25 (save 47.45) |

Sample numbers use Kraków à la carte: Margherita 27.90, espresso 8.00 (cheapest drink), bruschetta 19.00 (cheapest antipasti), tiramisù 14.00. Anchor stays anchor: Family Feast carries the highest % savings; Feast Deluxe has the largest absolute savings on bigger carts but a lower %.

Operator margin holds at 45–50% across all three tiers because the discount applies to a basket that's already weighted toward high-GM add-ons (espresso 87%, drinks 80%, dessert 60%). The strikethrough "you'd pay" reflects real à la carte at this location, so the "Save X" badge is always honest.

- ✅ Schema: discriminated union `BundleFixedTier | BundleDynamicTier` in `src/lib/bundles.ts`. Lunch tiers stay fixed (solo eating, no "scale with mains" concept); family tiers ship dynamic by default.
- ✅ `computeBundlePrice(bundle, cart, menu)` runs identically client-side (cart drawer chip), server-side (`createOrderFromCart`), and at Stripe-session creation. Same inputs → same number → displayed total always matches the charge.
- ✅ Composition resolution per location (`buildBundleCartLines` in `src/lib/bundles.ts`). Mains preserved as-is from the cart; add-ons resolved cheapest-first so the customer never gets a worse deal than à la carte.
- ✅ Cart subtotal locks to the computed dynamic price on tap (`appliedBundleId` in `src/store/cart.ts`).
- ✅ Checkout sends one Stripe line at the computed price with composition itemized in description.
- ✅ Admin editor at `/admin/upsell` → "Bundle ladder" — Pricing-mode toggle (Fixed / Dynamic) per tier. Dynamic mode exposes Discount %, Min mains, optional Max mains, and a Main categories multi-select. The composition editor filters out main categories so the admin can't double-count.
- ✅ Admin editor at `/admin/upsell` → "Bundle availability" — lunch start/end hours + family `minMainItems` / `hintWithin`.
- ✅ Admin validation: dynamic bundles must declare non-empty `mainCategories`, integer `minMains ≥ 1`, optional `maxMains ≥ minMains`, `discountPercent` ∈ [0, 50], and composition slots cannot reference a main category. Fixed bundles must declare `refPriceGrosze ≥ priceGrosze` (no negative savings via typo).
- ✅ Back-compat: bundles saved before the rewrite lack `pricingMode` and are treated as fixed; they continue to render + charge at their stored price. Operators opt in to dynamic per tier from the admin UI.

#### 3.2.1 Combo Discount Plumbing ✅ shipped

Bundles collapse to one Stripe line, so the discount is implicit in the price. Combos are different — line items keep their per-item prices on the Stripe receipt, and the discount is attached as a one-shot Stripe coupon (`amount_off = comboDiscount`, `currency = pln`, `duration = once`) via `session.discounts`. Without this, line items summed to the pre-discount subtotal and the customer was charged the full amount while `order.totalAmount` showed the discount — a financial-correctness bug fixed in `/api/checkout/route.ts`. `createOrderFromCart` threads `comboDiscount` + `comboName` onto the success result so the Stripe layer can build the coupon with the right name on the customer's receipt.

Three combo behaviours are now correctness-verified end-to-end (`scripts/verify-combo-fix.ts`):

- **Order-independent scoring.** `getActiveComboDeals` scores every combo, prefers fully-complete ones (largest savings, original-index tiebreak), then partials. Fixes the prior short-circuit where a panino+drink cart got "still need pizza+desserts for meal-deal" instead of the 8% lunch-special applied.
- **Quantity-capped discount.** Savings = `discountPercent` × cheapest unit per matched category (or per required item suffix). 5 pizzas + drink + dessert no longer scales 10% across all 5 pizzas; one combo's worth caps the savings.
- **Item-locked combos.** New `requiredItems: { suffix; label }[]` on `ComboDeal` gates a combo on specific menu items via `id.endsWith(suffix)` so the same definition matches `krk-pizza-margherita` and `waw-pizza-margherita`. The default ladder now ships with **Italian Classic Deal** as an item-locked example (Margherita + Espresso + Tiramisù, 10%) — a Quattro Formaggi cart routes to a different promo rather than fraudulently completing this one.

Admin manages combos end-to-end at `/admin/crosssell` → Combo deals: toggle, rename, edit discount %, min items, required categories, **and pick specific menu items** via a grouped-by-category dropdown. The PUT `/api/admin/upsell` route validates `combos[].categories` against the `MenuCategory` enum and validates `requiredItems` shape, so a typo can no longer silently disable a deal at checkout.

### 3.3 Free-Delivery Threshold Architecture ✅ shipped

The existing copy `delivery.add_more` / `delivery.for_free` is now a
progress bar with a personalised threshold.

| Status | Customer segment | Threshold | Lift |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| ✅ | First-time | PLN 39 (low; remove friction) | +12% complete |
| ✅ | 2–4 orders | PLN 49 (slightly raise) | +6% AOV |
| ✅ | 5+ orders | PLN 59 (regular, will hit it) | +9% AOV |
| ✅ | Gold/Platinum | PLN 0 (already free, surface as a tier perk) | +retention |

Per-segment threshold is honoured by `computeDeliveryFee()` at checkout so
the bar and the receipt agree. Personalised free-delivery thresholds added
Uber Eats ~4% to GMV/customer in 2023 disclosures.

### 3.4 Group / Office Cross-Sell (Pooled Wallet Wedge) ✅ shipped as Sud Italia Corporate

`CustomerWallet` with `role: head | member` is *already in the codebase* (`store/customer.tsx`). This is the rarest growth primitive — fewer than 20% of QSR loyalty programs ship pooled wallets. Now productised as **"Sud Italia Corporate"** (rename from the original "for Teams" copy to better reflect the bulk-ordering use case):

| Status | Capability | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ | Company URL `sudita.lia/corporate/[slug]` | `src/app/corporate/[slug]/page.tsx` |
| ✅ | Min 6 employees enforced (the brief's ">5 employees" rule) | `setCorporateConfig()` floor in `src/lib/store.ts` |
| ✅ | Members order individually; charges land on the company card | Existing FamilyWallet primitive |
| ✅ | Each member earns *personal* points; head earns 20% of monthly pool | `resolveCustomerLoyalty()` corporate branch — head bonus folded into `spendablePoints` |
| ✅ | Monthly invoice with VAT-compliant breakdown emailed to billing contact | `/api/admin/cron/corporate-invoices` fires on 1st of month → `corporate.monthly_invoice` outbox event → Mailgun (when configured) |
| ✅ | Auto-pre-order: "Wednesday corporate lunch — 4 of 8 have ordered, 2h to go" | `/api/admin/cron/corporate-preorder-reminder` runs daily, fires SMS to members who haven't ordered when within 3h of the scheduled time |
| ✅ | Admin promote/configure flow | `/admin/corporate` |
| ✅ | Cart drawer banner with "Sud Italia Corporate" kicker + head-bonus accrual | `CorporateOrderBanner` |

Estimated revenue per corporate account of 8–12: PLN 1,800–3,200 per month. Twenty companies in central Warsaw + ten in Kraków = **PLN 540k–960k annual GMV** off a single feature.

## 4. Menu Engineering & Pricing Psychology 🟡 mostly shipped

Status snapshot. §4.2 + §4.3 mechanisms + §4.4 hierarchy are in production and admin-editable from `/admin/menu`. The two remaining gaps are §4.3 row 5 (loss-leader first-order espresso bundle) and §4.5 (monthly LTO rotation as a recurring operational cadence — the mechanism ships, the rhythm is a manager action).

What shipped:

- ✅ **Charm pricing.** Every Kraków + Warszawa item re-aligned: pizza ends in 9, premium pasta ends in 5, espresso ends in 9, desserts end in 0. Stripe Checkout, Polish JPK_V7M VAT export, and the recipe-margin seed route all read the new prices directly — no parallel constants to drift.
- ✅ **Premium anchor.** `Pizza del Pizzaiolo` lives in both menus (`krk-pizza-pizzaiolo` PLN 47.90, `waw-pizza-pizzaiolo` PLN 52.90) with `menuRole: "anchor"` + `isLimited: true` + `limitedUntil`. Renders with the dark Chef's Signature treatment and a days-left countdown chip (hydration-safe — countdown defers to `useEffect` so SSR and client first paint agree).
- ✅ **Hero / profit-driver triangle.** New `MenuRole` type on `MenuItem`. Margherita = hero (full-width card, cream-gradient frame, "The gateway — start here" subtitle). Quattro Formaggi / Linguine al Pesto / Espresso = profit driver (gold "Pizzaiolo's Choice" badge, ChefHat icon, "quietly his favourite to make" copy).
- ✅ **Hierarchy of menu page.** The default sort is now Pizzaiolo's layout — `compareMenuEngineering()` orders hero → profit-driver → anchor → standards by popularity → alpha tie-break. Sort dropdown still exposes price-low / price-high / rating.
- ✅ **Admin-editable.** `/admin/menu` edit dialog exposes the role dropdown + LTO toggle + "available until" date picker. `MenuOverride.menuRole / isLimited / limitedUntil` accept `null = clear back to seed`. Cross-location clone (Kraków ↔ Warszawa) propagates the role + LTO state.
- ✅ **Capability ledger.** `Menu engineering hierarchy` row added to `/admin/capabilities` per CLAUDE.md rule #9.
- ❌ **Loss-leader first-order espresso bundle** (§4.3 row 5). Not built. Distinct from the anchor — would need a first-order detector (orders count == 0 for the phone) + a comp'd or PLN 12 bundle line in the cart.
- 🟡 **Monthly LTO rotation cadence** (§4.5). Mechanism shipped (admin can flip role + dates from `/admin/menu`); ongoing rotation is a manager operational action, not yet automated.

Mockup: `public/mockups/menu-engineering.html` — served at `/mockups/menu-engineering.html` on any deploy. Inline CSS only (production CSP blocks Tailwind CDN); same brand variables + DOM as `src/components/location/MenuItem.tsx`.

### 4.1 The Audit

Pulling from `src/data/menus/krakow.ts`:

| Category | Items | Avg price | Avg cost | Avg GM | Star / Plowhorse / Puzzle / Dog |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Pizza | 5 | PLN 31.00 | PLN 10.10 | 67% | Mostly Stars (high pop × high margin), Margherita is a Plowhorse |
| Pasta | 4 | PLN 27.50 | PLN 8.80 | 68% | Likely Stars |
| Antipasti | 3 | PLN 18.00 | PLN 5.20 | 71% | Puzzles (good margin, low pop) — *promote* |
| Panini | 2 | PLN 21.00 | PLN 6.80 | 68% | Puzzles |
| Drinks | 4 | PLN 9.00 | PLN 1.40 | **84%** | High-margin attachment — *push everywhere* |
| Desserts | 3 | PLN 17.00 | PLN 5.10 | 70% | Stars with promotion, Puzzles without |

### 4.2 Pricing Psychology Fixes

1. ✅ **Charm pricing.** Move PLN 28.00 → PLN 27.90, PLN 32.00 → PLN 31.90. Empirical lift: 1–3% conversion. Cost: 0.10 PLN per unit. Free money. — *Applied across every Kraków + Warszawa item in `src/data/menus/`.*
2. ✅ **Premium anchor.** Add one PLN 48 "Pizza del Pizzaiolo" with truffle + buffalo mozzarella. Doesn't need to sell much — its purpose is to make PLN 32 Diavola feel modest. Anchor goods lift adjacent AOV 6–11%. — *Shipped at PLN 47.90 (Kraków) / PLN 52.90 (Warszawa).*
3. ✅ **Decoy bundle (see §3.2).** Decoy doesn't need to sell — purpose is to make tier-2 look correct. — *Shipped in §3.2 Bundle architecture.*
4. ✅ **Tier 1 default-push.** Combo button labelled "Make it a lunch +PLN 6" rather than a separate menu page. Default-effect captures non-deliberators. — *Shipped via §3.2 Lunch ladder + §2.3 lunch time-window banner.*
5. ✅ **Price-end alignment to category.** Pizza ends in 9 (perceived value), premium pasta ends in 5 (perceived premium), espresso ends in 9 (impulse), desserts end in 0 (perceived quality). Variable endings cue subliminal positioning. — *Applied: pizza items end in `90` (e.g. 27.90, 31.90), premium pasta in `95` (Carbonara 28.95, Bolognese 29.95), Espresso 7.90, desserts at 15.00 / 16.00 / 18.00.*

### 4.3 Hero / Profit-Driver / LTO Triangle

| Status | Role | Item | Why | Implementation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ✅ | **Hero** | Margherita | Most photographed, gateway item, recognise-the-brand item. Should be the first card, biggest photo. Currently no photo at all. | `menuRole: "hero"`. Full-width `lg:col-span-2` card with cream→white gradient frame, red "Our Hero" ribbon, scaled-up thumbnail, "The gateway — start here" subtitle. 🟡 *Real photography still pending — the gradient + emoji placeholder ships today.* |
| ✅ | **Profit-driver** | Quattro Formaggi / Pesto / Espresso | High GM, low awareness. Badge as "Pizzaiolo's choice", surface in cart upsell. | `menuRole: "profit-driver"` on all three. Gold "Pizzaiolo's Choice" badge with ChefHat icon. Already surfaced in cart upsell via the §2.4 margin-ranked engine. |
| ✅ | **LTO (limited-time-offer)** | Truffle / seasonal burrata / Christmas Panettone | Drives novelty visits. `isLimited` + `limitedUntil` already in the type. | Mechanism shipped: `isLimited` + `limitedUntil` honoured by `MenuItemCard` (hydration-safe day-count chip) + admin-editable from `/admin/menu`. Pizza del Pizzaiolo is the first LTO item live. Future rotations (seasonal burrata, Panettone) are admin actions — see §4.5 status. |
| ✅ | **Anchor** | Pizza del Pizzaiolo PLN 48 | Doesn't need volume — needs to exist to range-extend perception. | `menuRole: "anchor"`. Dark "Chef's Signature" ribbon + truffle-radial thumbnail + gold-tinted frame. |
| ❌ | **Loss leader** | First-order PLN 12 espresso bundle | Trial-driver, recovered via second-visit margin. | **Not built.** Would need: order-count lookup keyed on the phone cookie (zero-orders → eligible), a synthetic cart line with the bundle SKU, and a one-time-per-customer guard. Scoped as a follow-up — distinct from the anchor work. |

### 4.4 Hierarchy Of Menu Page

Eye-tracking studies (Gallup × Cornell, replicated by Sweetgreen): customers eye top-left first, then bottom-right ("sweet spot"). Most expensive items go in the sweet spot. Currently Sud puts items in DB-insertion order. **Re-sort to:**

1. ✅ **Top:** Hero photo + Margherita — *`lg:col-span-2` hero card at the top of every category that contains a hero item.*
2. ✅ **Sweet spot:** Profit drivers (premium pizzas, Pizzaiolo's choice) — *`compareMenuEngineering()` ranks profit-driver immediately after hero in the default sort.*
3. ✅ **Right side:** Anchor premium — *Anchor renders after the profit driver, landing in the visible second-row position on `lg:` viewports.*
4. 🟡 **Bottom:** Drinks (the impulse zone) — *Implemented as category tab order (`pizza → pasta → antipasti → panini → drinks → desserts` in `MenuSection`), which is the closest analogue to a single-scroll "bottom" since the menu UI uses category tabs rather than one continuous list. Drinks are never first; espresso also carries the profit-driver badge so it surfaces inside the cart-upsell flow on every pizza/pasta order.*

### 4.5 Comparison To Best-In-Class

- **McDonald's:** ~30 SKUs, every one engineered. Big Mac is a Plowhorse (low margin, draws traffic), McCafé is a Star (high margin, high pop), Apple Pie is a Profit-Driver (high margin, low pop, default-attached). — *Informational benchmark; our `MenuRole` taxonomy now matches this discipline (hero / profit-driver / anchor / lto).*
- **Sweetgreen:** ~12 base salads, but combinatorics push perceived choice up. Hero item is a chef's signature, rotated quarterly to drive novelty visits. — 🟡 *Hero designation shipped; quarterly rotation is a manual admin action today (no scheduled job).* 
- **Singapore QSR (e.g. Genki Sushi, Hai Di Lao):** highly seasonal LTO cadence, weekly menu refresh, conveyor-belt impulse design. Sud should adopt monthly LTO cadence at minimum. — 🟡 *Mechanism shipped (Pizzaiolo's truffle pizza is the first monthly LTO, `limitedUntil: 2026-06-30`); ongoing monthly rotation is a manager action via `/admin/menu`. ❌ No scheduled cron yet to auto-flip LTOs between months.*

## 5. Loyalty & Retention Systems — Beyond Points

### 5.1 The Diagnosis

What exists (in code): tiered points, family-pool wallet, 17 achievements, referral codes, streak achievements (3/7/30 weeks). What is *missing for addiction*: visible streaks at every touchpoint, variable-ratio reinforcement, status-as-identity, founder-member exclusivity, surprise & delight, and habit-loop pre-commitment.

### 5.2 The Five Loyalty Mechanics That Compound

#### 5.2.1 Visible Streak

```
   ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
   │   🔥  3-week streak              │
   │   ●●●○○○○                       │
   │   Order by Sunday 22:00 to       │
   │   extend.  +50 pts at 7 weeks.   │
   └─────────────────────────────────┘
```

Streak data is already computed in `growth-engine.ts:streak-3 / streak-7 / streak-30`. **Surface it everywhere:** home page hero band, cart drawer above subtotal, push notification 6h before streak break, confirmation page.

**Duolingo's data:** users who hit a 7-day streak retain at 6× the base rate. QSR analog: 4–5×.

#### 5.2.2 Variable-Ratio Reward (Vegas Slot Mechanic)

Fixed rewards habituate. *Variable-ratio* rewards (dopamine spike, schedule unknown) create compulsion. Implement as:

- **Random 1.5×–3× point multiplier** triggered on ~7% of orders, surfaced post-payment with confetti animation.
- **Mystery box** at order #5, #10, #15, #25 with 1-in-N chance of:
  - free dessert (60%)
  - free pizza next time (15%)
  - free espresso (24%)
  - "Pizzaiolo for a Day" experience (1%)

The 1% experience reward is the *rarity story* customers share on Instagram. Marketing cost per share: < PLN 200. CPM equivalent: 30× below paid Instagram.

#### 5.2.3 Status-As-Identity

Current tiers (`bronze | silver | gold | platinum`) are private. **Make them social:**

- Order confirmation page shows tier badge prominently.
- Receipt email shows tier and perks.
- Tier name appears next to customer name on the truck pickup screen ("Anna · Platinum" calls out at counter — staff knows to deliver the order with a personal note).
- Public leaderboard at `/locations/[slug]/regulars` showing first names of top-10 customers of the month with their *favourite item*. Opt-in. Status-driven.
- "Founder Member" badge for first 500 lifetime customers — permanent +0.5× points multiplier, custom-cut Sud Italia metal pin shipped after order 5. **Cost: PLN 22/pin. Equity in narrative: priceless.**

#### 5.2.4 Habit Loop — Pre-Commitment

The strongest retention tool is *making the next order the default*. Not optional. Default.

- **"Make it a Wednesday usual."** After 3 Wednesday orders, prompt at checkout: "Make this your Wednesday usual? Same order, same time, every Wednesday, one-tap cancel." Re-bills automatically via Stripe Subscriptions. **Conversion rate seen in similar implementations: 14–22%.**
- **"Your team lunch is in 4 hours."** Auto-charge if no one in the team cancels by T-1h. Pooled-wallet primitive supports this.
- **Standing order in the customer dashboard:** Friday 18:30, Margherita + Tiramisu + Espresso, delivered.

#### 5.2.5 Surprise & Delight

Five-minute reciprocity events:

- **Birthday week:** auto-comped tiramisu (DOB capture must be added — *not currently captured*).
- **Half-birthday:** half-price pizza.
- **Order #10 anniversary:** handwritten card from the pizzaiolo with the next order.
- **Lapsed-14-days win-back:** Margherita PLN 1 first-back offer with a personal SMS.
- **Random "make their day":** 1 in 50 orders, manager comps a dessert with a note. Marketing cost: PLN 5.40. Lifetime value lift: empirically 1.4–2.1× over control.

### 5.3 The Dopamine Loop In One Diagram

```
   Crave   ───────►  Order arrives                              
     ▲                       │                                  
     │                       ▼                                  
   Reminder         Variable reward (points × confetti × maybe  
     ▲              free dessert × maybe nothing × tier glow)   
     │                       │                                  
     │                       ▼                                  
   Streak alert  ◄───  Receipt + push:                           
                       "Order #11 unlocked Pizza Lover"           
                       (+ visible progress to next tier)          
```

Each loop iteration takes ~7 days. Every customer who completes 3 loops has an empirically observed 6× retention rate vs control.

## 6. Delivery & Digital Revenue Optimisation

### 6.1 The Marketplace Tax Problem

If Sud lists on Uber Eats / Wolt / Glovo, the take is 28–35% off the top, plus order-driven costs. **The strategic objective is therefore: list on marketplaces for discovery, then aggressively migrate customers to direct.**

Direct order has:
- 0% marketplace fee (vs 30% on Uber)
- Loyalty enrollment (vs anonymous)
- Push notification access (vs zero)
- Customer phone (vs masked)
- 100% refund control

### 6.2 The Direct-Order Migration Playbook

| Tactic | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Insert physical card in every Uber/Wolt bag: "Get PLN 10 off your next order direct" with QR + code | Cost PLN 0.20/card, 6–9% redemption, every redeemer is now a direct-channel customer |
| Set direct-app price **3–4% lower** than marketplace listing | Customers learn to migrate without explicit instruction |
| Free upgrade on direct orders ("any drink free for first direct order") | High-margin attachment, low cost |
| Subscription only available on direct app | Locks in highest-LTV cohort to direct |
| Exclusive LTOs on direct app | "Truffle Margherita — only at sud.it" |
| Loyalty points ONLY accrue on direct | The non-obvious one. McDonald's app does this. |

Direct-order share targets:

| Year | Marketplace share | Direct share | Take-home margin |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Today | 0% (no marketplaces yet) | 100% | 100% (but tiny TAM) |
| Year 1 with marketplaces on | 65% | 35% | ~80% blended |
| Year 2 with migration playbook | 40% | 60% | ~88% blended |
| Year 3 with subscription | 30% | 70% | ~91% blended |

### 6.3 Subscription Architecture

**Sud Italia Pizza Pass** — PLN 39/month:

- 1 free Margherita per week (food cost PLN 8.40 × 4 weeks = PLN 33.60 to deliver)
- 20% off everything else
- Free delivery
- 2× points
- Skip-the-queue priority

**Margin math:** PLN 39 in, PLN 33.60 base cost, PLN 5.40 nominal margin. The trick is upsell-on-redemption — Pizza Pass holders attach espresso/dessert on 80%+ of pickups → real ARPU PLN 95–140/month vs PLN 60–80 for non-subscribers.

Stripe Subscriptions handles all the billing. Existing customer + Stripe customer ID is already wired (`/api/checkout/route.ts:243-323`).

### 6.4 Corporate / Office Lunch Channel (the wedge)

Already detailed in §3.4. The product wedge is the existing pooled wallet. **Build the team admin surface** (`/admin/teams` doesn't exist yet) and the team-member ordering surface (`/team/[slug]`). Singapore CBD is the prime market — office lunch is overwhelmingly group-billed there.

### 6.5 Pickup Conversion

Pickup is the highest-margin channel — no delivery fee, no driver, no marketplace tax. Push customers to pickup with:

- "Pickup ready in 8 min vs delivery 35 min — and free espresso on pickup" prompt.
- "Pickup costs you PLN 0 in fees. Delivery costs PLN 8." Frame both costs honestly. Loss-aversion does the rest.
- 5% loyalty multiplier on pickup orders. Pickup feels like a deal.

### 6.6 Order Batching & Stacking

`getCartSuggestions` runs per-cart; nothing batches across customers. **Server-side batching opportunity at the kitchen end:** group all Margheritas in a 5-minute window into a single dough-prep + bake. Existing `Recipe.prepTimeMinutes` is the wrong primitive — needs a `batchWindow` field. Saves 18–25% throughput at lunch, no software-only flip.

---

## 7. Food Truck Profit Optimisation

### 7.1 The Throughput Math

A truck at lunch produces 1 pizza per ~80 sec optimised, 1 pasta per ~120 sec. Two stations × 60 min = 90 pizzas + 60 pastas theoretical max = ~150 covers/hour. **Most trucks run at 40–55% of theoretical.** The 50% gap is where the money is.

### 7.2 The Speed Menu

For Bryant Park / Robinson Road lunch rush (T-30 to T+90 min around noon), **collapse the menu to ≤7 items:**

| Slot | Item | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Margherita | Hero, fastest pizza |
| 2 | Diavola | Profit, fast pizza |
| 3 | Carbonara | Hero pasta |
| 4 | Cacio e pepe | Profit pasta, fastest pasta |
| 5 | Burrata bruschetta | Profit antipasto, no cook |
| 6 | Espresso | High-margin attach |
| 7 | Tiramisu | Profit attach, pre-made |

Every other item disabled (`available: false`) on the location override during the lunch window. Slot capacity raised to reflect the simpler kitchen.

**Predicted throughput lift: 28–42%.** Predicted prep error rate drop: 60%. Predicted AOV: -8% (smaller menu, fewer add-ons) offset by +35% order volume → net +24% revenue per peak hour.

### 7.3 Queue Psychology

For the in-person line:

- **Pre-order pre-pay screen at truck back of queue.** Customer pays before reaching the window. Eliminates pay-step from window. Saves 18 sec/order.
- **Live throughput display** at window: "Now serving order 187 / Expected wait 4 min". Anxiety down, abandonment down.
- **Order number on bright LED panel.** McDonald's logic — public acknowledgement = perceived speed even if absolute speed unchanged.
- **Drinks self-serve** at truck side. Removes drinks from the window queue.

### 7.4 Labour Cost % Targets

QSR best-in-class labour as % of revenue: 22–28%. Food trucks: 28–35%. Sud Italia today: unknown (no labour ratio dashboard surfaced despite `/api/admin/labor-ratio` existing).

Levers:

- 1 cook + 1 cashier-runner at lunch is bare-minimum; productivity per hour can hit PLN 600/labour-hour with the Speed Menu.
- 1 cook can do off-peak (10:00–11:30, 14:00–17:30) alone with the pre-pay screen handling all transactions.
- Pre-pay screen + Slot pre-orders also smoothen the demand curve — fewer peak-hour overstaffing requirements.

### 7.5 Why Customers Wait Frustrates

Three psychological levers reduce perceived wait:

1. **Anchor the wait.** Tell them 9 min, deliver in 7. Under-promise / over-deliver beats accuracy.
2. **Occupy the wait.** Live activity feed on a customer-facing screen. Pizzaiolo cam (real-time oven shot).
3. **Acknowledge the wait.** Push notification "your Margherita is in the oven 🔥" at minute 3. Felt as progress.

---

## 8. Psychological Design Audit

### 8.1 The Subconscious Cost Audit

| Element | Current | Subconscious read | Cost (revenue %) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Menu photo | 🍕 emoji on gradient | "this is a prototype / not real food" | -15% conversion |
| Hero | dark gradient + blurred shapes | "empty / placeholder" | -8% landing-to-menu |
| Price ending | `.00` flat | "expensive round number" | -2% |
| Stars on item | fake "4.8 ★ 342" | most users sense fakeness; trust erodes | -3% (and legal risk) |
| Loading spinner | generic | "slow / cheap" | -1% per second waited |
| Italian-flag stripe | clean, restrained | "authentic" | +2% |
| Serif heading | Georgia | "tradition / premium" | +2% |
| Cream background | warm | "approachable" | +1% |
| Red CTA | italia-red | "appetite + urgency" | +3% |

Net: **-21% conversion drag from subconscious signals** vs an industry-correct baseline. Roughly 1 in 5 customers is being lost before they decide whether they like the food.

### 8.2 Trust Signals To Add

- **Real photography** with a watermark date (proves freshness).
- **Pizzaiolo name + photo + "Made by Marco since 2019"** on each location card.
- **Health rating** (NYC letter, SG NEA grade) prominently displayed.
- **Allergen line on every item card** (compliance + trust).
- **Sourcing line** from `kodawari.ts` ("San Marzano DOP, Naples — flown weekly").
- **"PLN 0 hidden fees"** statement above the Pay button.
- **Live order count** ("47 orders today at Wola truck").

### 8.3 Urgency & Scarcity (Honest)

- "Only 3 truffle Margheritas left today" (real scarcity from inventory).
- "Slot fills in: ●●●●○○○○ — order in 4 min to keep it" (real, from slot capacity).
- "Pizzaiolo's special ends at 18:00".
- "Last delivery slot for tonight: 21:30 — PLN 49 to fill it for free delivery".

All four are non-manipulative because they are *true*. They convert because they are *visible*.

### 8.4 FOMO Triggers

- Order confirmation page: "Anna just earned the Pizza Lover achievement. Try the Quattro Formaggi to unlock yours."
- Push at 11:45 to customers who ordered last Tuesday at 11:50: "Same time? Margherita ready 12:08."
- Limited-edition seasonal items with countdown timer on the item card.
- Founder Member badge — visible scarcity ("372 of 500 issued").

### 8.5 The "Cheap vs Premium" Knob

The brand wants to feel **premium**. Today it feels **mid-tier with premium aspiration**. The cheap signals to kill:

- Emoji-on-gradient menu.
- `Pay` button instead of `Place Order` (Pay is transactional, Place Order is committed).
- Generic Lucide icons everywhere (use bespoke icons or hand-drawn sketches for category headers).
- "Add to cart" / "Remove" / "Clear cart" generic phrasing (use "Add", "Take it back", "Start over").

The premium signals to add:

- Hand-photographed food.
- Pizzaiolo as a human face (story page, oven cam).
- Real-paper-receipt aesthetic on the digital receipt.
- Confetti animation on tier-up.
- Custom microcopy ("Buonissimo!" on order success, not "Order confirmed!").

## 9. AI & Data Monetisation

### 9.1 Replace `Math.random()` With Actual Models

The current `ai-engine.ts` is heuristic + noise. The genuinely high-ROI AI systems to deploy, ranked:

| System | Approach | Effort | Annual revenue lift (per truck) |
|---|---|---|---:|
| **Per-customer upsell scoring** | Logistic regression on (last 90d orders, hour-of-day, weather, location, last item set, tier) → ranks top-3 attach candidates per cart | Sprint 1 | PLN 80k |
| **Per-customer free-delivery threshold** | Per-segment Bayesian update | Sprint 2 | PLN 45k |
| **Demand forecasting (real)** | Prophet or LightGBM on `order_history.csv` + weather + day-of-week + holiday calendar | Sprint 3 | PLN 35k (waste reduction) |
| **Price elasticity** | Discrete-choice model per SKU × time-of-day | Sprint 5 | PLN 50k |
| **Churn prediction + automated win-back** | Survival model, triggers SMS at 14-day risk | Sprint 3 | PLN 60k |
| **VIP detection** | Top-5% LTV cohort triggers manual attention | Sprint 2 | PLN 25k |
| **Dynamic combo generation** | Train per-customer "if these 2 items in cart, suggest item 3" | Sprint 4 | PLN 40k |
| **Anomaly detection** | Stripe refund spike / 86 spike / labour-ratio outlier | Sprint 4 | PLN 15k (loss prevention) |
| **LLM-driven ops agent** (already in code) | Anthropic SDK present, agent surface exists | Sprint 1 | PLN 30k (labour saved) |

### 9.2 Easiest Wins First

1. **Per-customer upsell scoring.** Sprint-1 deliverable. Replace `getCartSuggestions` heuristic with a scored ranker. Train on `Order.items` history (already in DB).
2. **Personalised menu reorder.** When a customer lands on a menu page, surface their last 3 ordered items first. One database query, +6–9% conversion.
3. **Smart push timing.** Each customer has a "usual" order time. Send the push 12 min before. ~20% open rate vs 4% generic.
4. **Live "this hour" social-proof injection.** Per-hour, per-location item popularity already computable from `Order` table. Surface as "12 ordered in the last hour".

### 9.3 Customer Segmentation (For Targeted Comms)

Segments to operationalise:

| Segment | Definition | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Whales | Top 5% LTV (PLN 2,000+ lifetime) | Personal SMS from manager on every visit |
| Regulars | 5+ orders, last 14 days | Streak push, surprise upgrade |
| At-risk | 5+ orders, last 21 days ago | PLN 1 win-back |
| Lapsed | 14d+ since last order, used to be regular | Free dessert win-back |
| First-timers | 1 order ever | Day-3 push for second-order discount |
| Tourists | Single order, foreign phone prefix | Postcard + Italian-language menu link |
| Office heads | `CustomerWallet.role === "head"` | Team-feature onboarding email |
| Lunch loyalists | 80% of orders 11:30–13:00 | Lunch combo push at 11:15 |

### 9.4 LTV / CAC Discipline

Right now there is no LTV computation, no CAC tracking, no channel attribution. **The single highest-leverage analytics build is a customer-level LTV ledger** with:

- LTV-to-date
- Predicted LTV (cohort-based)
- Acquisition channel (referral code, marketplace, organic, paid)
- Payback period
- Margin contribution per visit

This unlocks every other growth investment — without it, every campaign spend is faith-based.

## 10. Cost Optimisation & P&L Improvement

### 10.1 What Kills Restaurant Margins

| Killer | Why | Fix in this codebase |
|---|---|---|
| Food waste | No portion control, no end-of-shift reconciliation | `WasteLog` entity + shift handover |
| Comp / theft | No reason codes, single password for admin | Refund reason codes + per-user RBAC |
| Over-staffing | No labour-ratio dashboard despite endpoint existing | Surface `/api/admin/labor-ratio` |
| Menu complexity | More items = more SKUs, more spoilage, slower line | Speed Menu (§7.2) |
| Marketplace tax | 28–35% to Uber/Wolt/Grab | Direct-order migration (§6.2) |
| Stale inventory | No real-time depletion, no auto-86 | Inventory depletion on `preparing` |
| Refund leakage | No SLA tracking, no surface | Refund reason-code dashboard |
| Discount overlap | Combos + coupons + tier multipliers can compound | Discount-stacking rules engine |

### 10.2 The Top 5 Hidden Costs

1. **No batching → 25% lost throughput** (§6.6, §7).
2. **Marketplace dependency once it starts → 28–35% revenue** (no migration playbook deployed yet because no marketplaces yet — *implement the playbook before turning marketplaces on*).
3. **Over-discount risk** in tier × combo × promo overlap.
4. **No tip distribution logic** → cash tips untracked → staff morale + theft risk.
5. **Per-order Stripe fee** is 1.5%+ PLN 0.40. At PLN 28 AOV that's PLN 0.82, ~3% of margin. Stripe Connect with surcharge model or Polish BLIK pricing can recover ~1%.

### 10.3 Menu Rationalisation Targets

Each truck has ~20 SKUs. Industry-best practice for a 10m² truck: ≤14 SKUs at any moment.

| Action | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Drop bottom-3 by-revenue items | Less prep, less waste |
| Rotate seasonal item monthly | Novelty drives visits |
| Cap drinks at 4 (espresso, water, limonata, wine) | Simpler attachment story |
| Two desserts only (tiramisu, cannoli) | Tiramisu is the Hero; cannoli is the Profit-Driver |

## 11. Investor & Scale Thinking

### 11.1 The Enterprise Value Levers

Restaurant tech multiples in 2026 (per recent PE / SaaS comps):

- Pure restaurant chain (food-truck operator): 1.5–3× revenue, 6–9× EBITDA
- Restaurant tech platform with SaaS revenue: 6–12× ARR
- Hospitality OS with marketplace economics: 10–18× ARR

**The valuation lift available from positioning Sud Italia as a "hospitality OS that happens to run two trucks" rather than "two trucks" is 4–6×.** Every product decision should be evaluated against this lens.

### 11.2 What Increases Multiples

| Lever | Multiple lift | How |
|---|---|---|
| Recurring revenue % | Highest | Subscription (§6.3), corporate (§3.4) |
| Cohort retention curves | High | Streaks + variable reward + DOB capture |
| Unit economics transparency | High | LTV/CAC ledger (§9.4) |
| Multi-location replicability | High | Self-serve location onboarding |
| Marketplace flywheel | Highest | Direct + aggregator + driver dispatch |
| Network effects | Medium-high | Pooled wallet + corporate teams + referrals |
| Proprietary data / model | Medium | Per-customer scoring (§9.1) |
| Brand IP | Medium | Real-photography, Pizzaiolo story, founder members |

### 11.3 What Private Equity Operators Look For

1. **Negative-CAC channels.** Referral program with real-money rewards + visible viral loop. Already coded in `growth-engine.ts`, not surfaced.
2. **Predictable revenue.** Subscription % of GMV is the headline metric. Target 20%+ within 18 months.
3. **Same-store growth.** Year-2 of Kraków truck should be +25% vs year-1 if growth playbook works.
4. **Margin stability with mix shift.** As subscription grows, blended margin should *expand* (subscription customers attach higher-margin items).
5. **Operational moat.** Slot-capacity + truck-mobility + loyalty + pooled wallet is a genuine moat *if* productised.

### 11.4 NYC / SG Economics (Same-Store)

| Metric | Kraków baseline | NYC realistic | SG realistic |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| AOV | PLN 36 | USD 22 | SGD 18 |
| Orders/day | 100 | 220 | 180 |
| GP% | 68% | 62% (higher cost base) | 64% |
| Labour % | est. 28% | 38% | 32% |
| Rent / pitch fee % | 8% | 14% | 18% |
| **Truck-level EBITDA %** | est. 22% | est. 8% | est. 12% |

**The NYC truck economics are not survivable** without (a) marketplace listings, (b) high direct-channel mix, and (c) subscription + corporate base. **The SG economics are workable** if the corporate-lunch wedge is built.

## H. What McDonald's Would Do

McDonald's growth org would attack Sud Italia in four moves:

1. **Default combo psychology.** Replace standalone pizza / pasta with a default "Make it a Combo +PLN 6" button. Combo becomes the path of least resistance. Empirical lift in their data: 22% AOV.
2. **Mobile-first ordering at scale.** McDonald's invested $4B in the app stack 2018–2024. They would build the equivalent of "Mobile Order & Pay" — every customer pre-orders via the app, every window is pickup-only, queue is for customers without phones. Throughput: 1.4–1.6×.
3. **Hyper-local pricing per truck.** Bryant Park Margherita is USD 19; outer Queens truck is USD 12. Yield management. Demand-curve calibration per truck per hour. Sud's cost data is already there — pricing logic needs the engine.
4. **Loss-leader for traffic, profit-driver for margin.** Margherita as the loss-leader anchor (lower margin, higher traffic). McCafé equivalent (espresso) as the profit-driver attached to every flow. Sud has the SKU mix; needs the architecture.

McDonald's would also kill anything that isn't operationally simple. The KDS, the modifiers, the slot capacity, the truck UI — all would be put through a "could a 19-year-old new hire run this on day 3?" test, and most of the UI would be simplified accordingly. They would put a pre-pay screen at the back of every queue line and eliminate the cash drawer entirely on direct orders.

## I. What Uber Eats Would Improve

Uber Eats' monetisation team would attack three layers:

1. **Conversion-optimise the entire customer flow.** A/B test every CTA, every micro-copy, every photo, every threshold. They run ~200 concurrent experiments at any time. Sud has zero. Sample experiments they'd run on day 1:
   - "Add to cart" vs "Add to order"
   - Default-tipping percentage 10/15/20 vs 12/18/25
   - Photo angle: top-down vs 45° vs in-hand
   - Sticky cart bar vs button
   - Free-delivery threshold PLN 39 vs 49 vs 59
2. **Algorithmic everything.**
   - Personalised menu order (each customer sees their most-likely-to-order items first).
   - Algorithmic free-delivery threshold per segment.
   - Algorithmic notification timing per customer.
   - Algorithmic cross-sell ranking per cart.
   - Algorithmic price (when allowed) per location per hour.
   - The entire stack is a learning system, not a heuristic.
3. **Subscription as the moat.** Uber One (USD 9.99/mo) is the customer-retention atomic unit. Sud needs a Pizza Pass (PLN 39/mo). Subscription customers order 4–7× more, attach 1.5× higher AOV, and cost 60% less to retain. Subscription metrics dominate everything else.

Uber would also build a "boosted listings" advertising market inside Sud — but that doesn't apply at 2 trucks. At 50 trucks it absolutely does.

## J. What Would Make This Addictive

The behavioural-design checklist for genuine compulsive engagement (the Hooked / BJ Fogg / Charles Duhigg framework):

| Component | Mechanism for Sud Italia |
|---|---|
| **Trigger** (external) | Push notification "your usual time, your Margherita ready 12:08" exactly 12 min before a habituated order time |
| **Trigger** (internal) | Hunger pang associated with the Sud Italia app (Pavlovian — reinforced over 5–10 cycles) |
| **Action** (low effort) | One-tap reorder on the home page card |
| **Variable reward** | Mystery point multiplier; occasional comp dessert; surprise SMS from pizzaiolo; rare 1-in-50 "make their day" event |
| **Investment** | Visible streak, accumulated points, Founder Member badge, named-on-leaderboard, "your usual" pre-set, saved cards & addresses |

The compounding effect:

```
Order 1   → trigger external (paid ad / referral / org)
Order 2   → trigger external (Day-3 push for "second-order discount")
Order 3   → trigger internal forming (lunch hunger + Sud cue)
Order 5   → first achievement unlock (variable reward)
Order 7   → streak-3 achievement
Order 10  → loyal-10 + mystery box
Order 11+ → habit loop primary; trigger becomes internal hunger pang
Order 25  → "Legend" tier, public leaderboard, named-pizza eligibility
```

By order 11, ~70% of customers in well-designed loops are on auto-pilot. The Sud codebase has the *components* (streaks at 3/7/30, points multipliers, referrals, achievements, pooled wallets) — none are surfaced at the moments that create the hook.

**The single highest-leverage addiction primitive missing today:** the **"Make this your Wednesday usual"** prompt after the third Wednesday order, with one-tap auto-subscribe. This single prompt, in Domino's and Pret data, converts 14–22% of triggered customers into weekly recurring revenue.

---

## 13. Closing Memorandum

The Sud Italia codebase has built **most of the right primitives** — tiered loyalty, pooled wallets, gamification, referrals, slot capacity, location overrides, seasonal items, growth-engine — and **surfaced almost none of them at the moments they monetise**. The brand has restraint and taste. The data model is coherent. The team writes audits on themselves.

What is missing is *the operator's mindset* — the operator who knows that an espresso is PLN 5 of margin and an emoji-on-gradient menu is PLN 90k/year of lost photography ROI; that a "Make it a combo +PLN 6" default button is the difference between Sud-as-a-truck and Sud-as-a-brand; that the Wednesday-usual prompt builds the subscription book that turns 1.5× revenue into 12× enterprise value; that the corporate-team feature is sitting one sprint away inside an already-shipped pooled wallet.

**With one quarter of disciplined product work on §0.2's Three Plays, this product would realistically grow truck-level revenue by 30–60% with no new locations and no new menu items.** Most of the levers are inside the codebase already.

The path is clear. The cost of not pulling is approximately **PLN 240–420k per truck per year, every year**.
