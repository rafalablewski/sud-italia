# Core · Service

The merged Floor + Slots surface. `/core/service` (redirects to Floor).
Three nested views via `serviceTabs` (`src/core/service/serviceTabs.ts`): Floor · Slots · Dispatch.

## Floor (`/core/service/floor`) — wired

- **Live code:** `src/core/service/CoreFloor.tsx`.
- **Theme:** `.core-floor` / `.core-zone-h` / `.core-tables` / `.core-tbl2`
  (+ `.core-tbl2-wrap` / `.core-tbl2-edit`) · `.core-floor-bar` / `.core-fchip` ·
  `.core-tbl-field` · `.core-bottleneck` in `themes/core/index.css`.
- The live room: a 5-up KPI strip (covers seated · occupancy · turn time ·
  **spend / hr** · freeing ≤15m) over zoned table tiles. Each `.core-tbl2`
  is toned by state — free · seated · **freeing** (predicted ≤15m) ·
  reserved · out-of-service — and shows party / dwell / open check; hover
  reveals a `⋯` **edit** affordance.
- **Tap a table → its check opens as a panel over the floor** — the core IA
  move. The tile's main tap mounts the **embedded till** (`<CorePos embedded>`)
  in a docked `.core-check-panel` inside a `.core-check-overlay` scrim, portaled
  into the **`.core` theme root** (not `document.body`, so it keeps core tokens —
  same rule as `CoreDialog`). The panel opens (or focuses) that table's dine-in
  check with the party as covers and is where build / modify / course / split /
  pay all happen — **no navigation to a separate till**. The panel header is
  table-forward (back-arrow · **Table N** · party + item count + running total ·
  QR · Done); **Esc** or the back-arrow closes it, the scrim-click dismisses, and
  body scroll is locked while it's open. Closing reloads the
  floor so pay-status / occupancy refresh. An occupied tile also carries a small
  secondary **Free** button (`.core-tbl2-clear`) to clear the table without
  opening the check. Floor is Core's **home** (`/core` and `/core/service`
  both land here; the bottom switcher leads with **Floor**).
- **Predictive-seating recommender** (`.core-floor-bar`): type a party size
  and `recommendSeating(twin, n)` ranks best-fit tables as `.core-fchip`
  chips — *seat* now or *~Nm* until free; click to seat directly.
- **Table CRUD**: *+ Add table* (subbar) / the per-tile `⋯` opens the
  `TableDialog` (core `CoreDialog`, portaled) — number · seats · zone
  · status, with delete.
- The **kitchen-bottleneck banner** (`.core-bottleneck`) fires when the KDS
  engine reports a strained station.
- **Engine:** `GET /api/admin/floor-twin?location=` → `{ twin, kitchen }`
  (visibility-aware 15s `usePolling`; create/edit/delete merge optimistically
  into the twin so a tile never blanks until the refetch lands); seat/clear =
  `POST /api/admin/floor-twin { action, tableId }`;
  table create/update = `POST /api/admin/floor/tables?location=`, delete =
  `DELETE /api/admin/floor/tables?location=&id=`.

## Slots (`/core/service/slots`) — wired

- **Live code:** `src/core/service/CoreSlots.tsx`.
- **Theme:** `.core-slot-list` / `.core-slot` (capacity bars, `.core-slot-min`
  min-spend badge) · `.core-slot-week` / `.core-slot-day-h` (week grouping) ·
  `.core-tier-d` / `.core-act` (the demand board).
- Two tabs: **Manage** — a **Day / Week** toggle over the slot list, each
  row a capacity fill bar (green→amber→red ≥85%), covers, channels, a
  min-spend badge when set, and an active/draft toggle, over a KPI strip
  (slots · booked · fill rate · demand-price multiplier; week mode
  aggregates the seven days, grouped under `.core-slot-day` headers).
  **Demand** — the Demand Exchange: per-slot forecast vs capacity with a
  **tier** (under · healthy · tight · over · kitchen-capped) and a
  recommended lever spelled out in prose (**Raise capacity · Trim /
  promote · Protect kitchen · Hold**); Apply one or Apply-all.
- **Create** (`+ New`) opens a `CoreDialog` with a **Single / Bulk**
  mode toggle: Single posts one slot (time + capacity); Bulk generates a
  start→end range at an interval.
- **Engine:** `GET /api/admin/slots?location=[&date=]` (day = date-scoped,
  week = whole location sliced client-side) +
  `GET /api/admin/demand-exchange?location=&date=` (forecast); toggle =
  `PUT /api/admin/slots`; create = `POST /api/admin/slots` (single) /
  `POST /api/admin/slots?bulk=1` (range); delete =
  `DELETE /api/admin/slots?id=`; apply = `POST /api/admin/demand-exchange`
  (`{ slotId, maxOrders, minSpendGrosze }` single / `{ mode: "apply-all" }`).

Wired 1:1 to the same shared server engine. The booking console (slot + table
in one move) lives in the Guest hub's **Book** view (`CoreBook`), shared.

## Floor — live orders, lookup & notes

Live code: `src/core/service/CoreFloor.tsx` · API `src/app/api/admin/floor/orders/route.ts` (orders) + `/api/admin/floor/tables` (CRUD, now incl. `notes`) + `/api/admin/floor-twin`.

The Floor board pairs the predictive twin with the table's **live orders**:

- **Per-table status chip** — each tile shows what the table owes, driven by
  `GET /api/admin/floor/orders` (today's active orders, grouped by `tableId`,
  tagged with channel + paid/unpaid). Unpaid → a brand `… to pay` chip
  (prefixed `QR ·` for QR-channel orders); fully paid → a basil `✓ paid` chip.
  A glanceable service-note chip (`.core-tnote-chip`) sits on the tile; a note
  naming an allergy/dietary risk goes amber (`.alrg`, `⚠`) so it reads across
  the room, not on hover. Polls every 10s.
- **To pay KPI** — count of unpaid active orders across the floor.
- **Order lookup** — a `⌕ Find order` box filters active orders by id, guest
  name or table number; each result shows channel + paid status with a
  **Mark paid** action (`POST /api/admin/floor/orders {action:"settle"}` →
  `updateOrder` sets `paidAt`, fires a still-pending order to the kitchen).
- **Table detail** (the `⋯` editor) — adds a **Service note** textarea
  (persisted on `FloorTable.notes`, threaded through `buildFloorTwin` →
  `TwinTableRow.notes`) and an **Orders at this table** list with the same
  settle action.

## Dispatch (`/core/service/dispatch`) — wired

- **Live code:** `src/core/service/CoreDispatch.tsx`; API
  `src/app/api/admin/dispatch/route.ts`; store helper `assignOrderDriver`
  (`src/lib/store.ts`).
- **Theme:** token-styled inline (no new `.core-*` classes) so it inherits the
  active skin's glass; reuses `.core-btn` / `.core-chip` / `.core-iconbtn`.
- The delivery driver board. `GET /api/admin/dispatch?location=` returns the
  active delivery orders (`fulfillmentType==="delivery"`, status in
  confirmed→preparing→ready→assigned→picked_up, non-simulated) plus the
  location's **drivers** (staff whose role is in the `delivery` group —
  `driver`/`courier` — and `status==="active"`).
- Three KPIs (in kitchen · ready to go · on the road) over a card grid. Each
  card shows `#shortId`, delivery address, item count + total + customer, a
  status chip, and driver controls: unassigned cards show one-tap **assign
  chips**; an assigned card shows the driver + **Unassign**.
- Writes go through `PUT /api/admin/dispatch` — `{orderId, driverId}` calls
  `assignOrderDriver` (sets `Order.assignedDriverId`; the `assigned_driver_id`
  column + row mappers already existed) and `{orderId, status}` advances the
  lifecycle via the shared `updateOrderStatus` (assigned → picked_up →
  delivered). Both are audit-logged (`orders.assign_driver` /
  `orders.status_change`). The board polls every 8s. No parallel money/lifecycle
  state — it drives the same `Order`.
