# Core · Service

The merged Tables + Slots surface. `/core/service` (redirects to Tables).
Four nested views via `serviceTabs` (`src/core/service/serviceTabs.ts`): **Book · Tables · Slots · Dispatch**. (Book moved here from the top-level Lens Rail / the Guest hub — it is a Service view, reached from the Tables lens, and is no longer its own lens.)

## Tables (`/core/service/tables`) — wired

- **Live code:** `src/core/service/CoreTables.tsx`.
- **Theme:** `.core-surf-toolbar` ActionBar (with the **`Zone` scope switch** as
  a `.core-seg` in its `left`) ·
  `.core-surf-toolbar` (Refresh · Add zone · Add table, right) · `.core-statstrip` ·
  `.core-floor` / `.core-zone-group` / `.core-zone-h` (+ `.core-zone-tools` /
  `.core-zone-tool` / `.core-zone-tool.del` / `.core-zone-rename-inp` /
  `.core-zone-empty`) / `.core-tables` / `.core-tbl2` (+
  `.core-tbl2-wrap` / `.core-tbl2-edit` / `.core-tbl2.is-dragging`) ·
  `.core-tbl-field` /
  `.core-tbl-features` / `.core-tbl-feat` in `themes/core/index.css`; the
  tile cursor/focus ring + zone-header hairline live in
  `themes/core/parity/tables.css`.
- **The table PLAN, not the live room.** This surface does exactly one job:
  manage the physical layout — **zones, tables, seats**. There is deliberately
  **no seating, no order lookup, no live occupancy** here; that operational
  flow lives in **Book** (`/core/service/book`, whose Floor lens seats parties
  and opens checks) and **POS**. Rendered in the **dense-console** language: the
  `.core-surf-toolbar` ActionBar whose `left`
  carries the optional
  **`Zone` scope switch** (a `.core-seg` — `Zone · All zones · <zone>×N`, shown
  when there is more than one zone) that filters the zoned groups, a
  `.core-surf-toolbar` (Refresh · Add table), then a **6-up `.core-statstrip`**
  — **tables · seats · zones ·
  available · out-of-service · accessible** — every figure derived live from
  the table catalogue (Rule #1; value colours read info/basil/amber/brand,
  each cell carries a mono delta).
- **Zones are first-class entities**, not derived from tables — a separate
  per-location list (`FloorZone` in `src/lib/store.ts`, served by
  `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/admin/floor/zones?location=`), so **an empty zone
  persists** (moving the last table out of a zone leaves the zone standing).
  Tables still reference their zone by **name** (`FloorTable.zone`); the store
  keeps the two in sync — `reconcileZones` (run on GET) back-fills a zone entity
  for any distinct `table.zone` not yet listed (so legacy floor plans and zones
  typed straight into the editor surface as managed rows), `renameZone` cascades
  the new name onto member tables, and `deleteZone` frees member tables (they
  drop to **Unzoned**) rather than deleting them. `getZones`/mutations are
  manager+ (reads staff+). The board groups tables under those entities in
  `position` order (`.core-zone-h` header with a `N tables · N seats` sub and a
  hairline rule); a zone with no tables shows a dashed **`.core-zone-empty`**
  ("Drop a table here") drop target; tables whose zone isn't (yet) an entity
  fall into transient **orphan** groups, and zoneless tables into a trailing
  **Unzoned** group.
- **Add zone** (toolbar right) creates a `New zone` entity and drops straight
  into inline-rename (`addZone`); the store auto-uniquifies the name.
  Each zone group (`.core-zone-group`) is a **drop target**: a tile is
  `draggable`, and dropping it on another group rewrites that table's `zone`
  (`reassignZone` → the same status-preserving `persistTableZone` write the
  editor uses, so a move never clobbers a live seating transition). The dragged
  tile dims (`.core-tbl2.is-dragging`) and the hovered group lights
  (`.core-zone-group.drop-target`). A managed zone header carries a hover
  **tool cluster** (`.core-zone-tools`): `✎` (`.core-zone-tool`) swaps the
  title for an input (`.core-zone-rename-inp`) — committing PATCHes the entity
  and cascades the name (`commitRename`) — and `×` (`.core-zone-tool.del`)
  deletes the zone (`removeZone`; confirms first when the zone still holds
  tables, which then become Unzoned). Tiles are **`.core-tbl2` cards** with a
  status-tinted left accent rail: **available** = basil (`free`) · **reserved**
  muted (`booked`) · **out-of-service** faded (`oos`) · a table already
  **seated** by ops shows info-toned. Each tile reads a big `T`-prefixed table
  number + a lowercase status dot, a seats line (`N seats`), and a feature
  line (the accessibility glyphs `♿ · 🍼 · ▭`, or `N-top` when none), plus an
  optional `📝` service-note chip.
- **Tap a tile (or its `⋯`) → the table editor.** Both open the `TableDialog`
  (core `CoreDialog`, portaled per Rule #4). It edits **only the physical plan**:
  **number/label · seats · zone · Accessibility features**, with **Delete**.
  **Status and the service note are deliberately absent** — they're operational
  and owned by Book/POS; the editor carries them through untouched on save
  (re-reads the table's live `status` right before the whole-row write so an
  edit can't clobber a seating transition, and preserves `FloorTable.notes`
  verbatim). **Zone is a picker of the zones that already exist** (create one
  from the board's *Add zone*), plus a *— No zone —* option; if a row's current
  zone isn't yet a managed entity it stays selectable so an edit never moves the
  table off it. Accessibility toggles (`.core-tbl-features` / `.core-tbl-feat` —
  accessible · high-chair · step-free) persist on `FloorTable.features` (matched
  by the seating engine against a party's needs). *+ Add table* sits in the
  ActionBar right.
- **Engine:** `GET /api/admin/floor/tables?location=` returns the location's
  `FloorTable[]` (gentle 20s `usePolling` — this is config, not the live floor;
  create/edit/delete merge optimistically so a tile never blanks until the
  refetch lands); create/update = `POST /api/admin/floor/tables?location=`,
  delete = `DELETE /api/admin/floor/tables?location=&id=`. The same catalogue
  every surface shares — a table added here shows up in the POS picker and Book
  instantly.

## Slots (`/core/service/slots`) — wired

- **Live code:** `src/core/service/CoreSlots.tsx`.
- **Theme:** `.core-surf-toolbar` (ActionBar) · `.core-statstrip` ·
  `.core-surge-banner` · `.core-slots-grid` (two-column) · `.core-frame` /
  `.core-frame-h` / `.core-frame-b` · Manage rows `.core-mslot` (`.barwrap` /
  `.mbar` fill + `.meta` + `.core-tchip` tier chip + `.mcap`) ·
  `.core-slot-week` / `.core-slot-day-h` (week grouping) · Demand rows
  `.core-exch-head` / `.core-applyall` / `.core-exrow` / `.core-tier` /
  `.core-lever` (`.lv` + `.why`) / `.core-apply`.
- Rendered in the **dense-console** language: the `.core-surf-toolbar` ActionBar
  whose `left` leads with the **`Mode` switch** (Manage | Demand, a `.core-seg`),
  then Day / Week and the shared **`CoreDateField`** picker; on the right the
  **Fulfillment** filter collapses into a `CoreFilterMenu` funnel, then a standard
  `.core-iconbtn` Refresh and the New-slot pill. Then a **6-up
  `.core-statstrip`** — **booked · capacity · fill ·
  surge windows · peak fill · demand price** (all live from the slot set —
  Rule #1; a "surge window" is one filled ≥85%, peak drives the price
  multiplier). When any window is ≥85% a **`.core-surge-banner`** offers a
  one-tap *Apply surge levers* — its `.sb-h` title and `.sb-s` detail are
  block-level so they stack (title over detail) like the mockup, not jammed
  onto one line.
- **Manage** and **Demand exchange** are shown **side by side** in
  `.core-slots-grid` (not tab-switched — both columns are live; the grid
  stacks below 1000px):
  - **Manage · service windows** — each `.core-mslot` is a capacity fill bar
    (basil→amber→danger ≥85%), a booked/status meta line, a **tier chip**
    (healthy · tight · full) that doubles as the **active/draft toggle**, and
    `N / max`; hover reveals a delete affordance. Week mode groups the seven
    days under `.core-slot-day` headers.
  - **Demand exchange** — per-slot forecast vs capacity with a **tier**
    (under · healthy · tight · over · kitchen-capped) and a **lever** (`.lv`
    raise / protect / trim / hold + a `.why` note); **Apply** one or the
    **⚡ Apply all** header action.
- **Create** (`+ New slot`) opens a `CoreDialog` with a **Single / Bulk**
  mode toggle: Single posts one slot (time + capacity); Bulk generates a
  start→end range at an interval.
- **Engine:** `GET /api/admin/slots?location=[&date=]` (day = date-scoped,
  week = whole location sliced client-side) +
  `GET /api/admin/demand-exchange?location=&date=` (forecast); toggle =
  `PUT /api/admin/slots`; create = `POST /api/admin/slots` (single) /
  `POST /api/admin/slots?bulk=1` (range); delete =
  `DELETE /api/admin/slots?id=`; apply = `POST /api/admin/demand-exchange`
  (`{ slotId, maxOrders, minSpendGrosze }` single / `{ mode: "apply-all" }`).

Wired 1:1 to the same shared server engine. The booking console (slot + table
in one move) is the **Book** view — see below.

## Book (`/core/service/book`) — wired

`src/core/service/CoreBook.tsx` — a **Service** view (`serviceTabs("book")`,
eyebrow `Service · Book`), alongside Floor · Slots · Dispatch. Legacy
`/core/book` and `/core/guest/book` redirect here. Rendered in the
**dense-console** language (mockup 11-book): the `.core-surf-toolbar` ActionBar
(its `left` led by the View switch — timeline/floor/arrivals), then a **12-cell
`.core-statstrip.is-wrap`** day summary — **tables · reservations · walk-ins ·
covers · seated · upcoming · no-shows · orders · avg/table · avg order · revenue ·
fill**. Reservations vs walk-ins split on `Reservation.source`; covers carries
avg party; tables shows in-service + total seats. The **orders / avg-per-table /
avg-check / revenue** cells come from the day's real **dine-in orders** (fetched
from `/api/admin/orders`, filtered to `fulfillmentType === "dine-in"` on the
selected `slotDate`, cancelled excluded) — Rule #1, no mock figures. The `is-wrap`
variant lays the cells out as a wrapping CSS grid (`repeat(auto-fit, minmax(132px,
1fr))`, 1px gap over a line-tinted container for hairline gridlines) so all twelve
stay readable — 2-up on a phone, filling out on wider screens — instead of the
single-row flex squishing them. `fill` = booked covers ÷ total seats. A `.core-book-tlbar` gives the
timeline a title + a status **legend** (confirmed · seated · pending · conflict).
The **timeline-over-tables grid** (`.core-book-tlpanel`, 17:00→23:00 in 30-min
ticks): reservation **blocks** are positioned by time/duration and **toned by
status** (`.core-bk-blk.seated` info / `.pending` amber), **overlaps hatch red**
live (`.conflict`, one `findReservationConflicts` pass per booking), and a block
**drags to another table row to reassign** (HTML5 drag → the reservations `POST`
upsert with `override`). The timeline sits **left**; the **new-reservation form
is the right rail**. The timeline + form live in their **own 2-col sub-grid**
(`.core-book-tlform`, `1fr 340px`) that spans the outer `.core-book` grid
(`grid-column: 1 / -1`), so the full-width **Today's bookings** list below is
*unambiguously beneath them* and can never interleave with or overlap the form.
The rail (`.core-book-form`, sub-grid col 2) simply **flows** — `align-self:
start`, no `position: sticky`, no `max-height`, no internal body scroll — so the
whole `.core-book` panel scrolls through it, Book button included. Two earlier
bugs forced this: a `max-height: calc(100dvh - <hardcoded strip height> …)` cap
stranded the button below the fold once the day-summary strip grew taller; and
keeping `position: sticky` after dropping the cap left the rail taller than the
viewport, so the full-width bookings list scrolled up and painted *over* it.
Below 1000px the sub-grid collapses to one column (`.core-book-tlform:
grid-template-columns: 1fr`). To fill it: pick a capacity-tinted
dine-in slot chip (`.core-bk-slotchip`; the selected chip is a translucent
**brand-wash**) + party size, then a table — ranked by the **Seating
Intelligence Engine** (`src/lib/seating.ts`, `suggestTables`): once a slot gives
a seating time, every table is hard-filtered (fit · free-for-the-turn ·
availability) then scored (right-size · runway · guest · pacing · yield), so the
✨ Recommend row is the engine's top pick and each row's tag + tooltip is its
reason (e.g. `held 32m`, `large table — protected for big parties`, `VIP hold`,
`patio full this window`, `89 pts · exact fit`). Excluded tables dim. Entering a returning guest's **phone** pulls their CRM seating profile
(`.core-bk-guestmatch`, GET `/api/admin/floor/guest-prefs` → `getGuestSeatingProfile`
— VIP standing from spend/visits/loyalty, usual table + zone from reservation
history) and feeds it into the engine's `guest` signal, so a regular is nudged
toward their usual table/zone. Below the
picker a **signals panel** (`.core-bk-signals`) lays the score open for the
chosen (or recommended) table: the weighted contribution of each of the **six**
signals as a labelled bar (`.sg-bar` — fit/runway/guest/pacing/yield/**section**,
each colour-coded), the 0–100 total, a **facts** row (`.sg-facts` — confidence %,
expected turn ±band, and the predicted **frees-at** time), the `reasons`, and a
**shadow** badge when shadow mode is on — so a pick is never a black box. Before a slot is picked it falls back to a plain
capacity check. A **Guest needs** chip row (`.core-bk-needs` — accessible ·
high-chair · step-free) hard-filters the picker to tables that offer every
required feature (tables carry `features`, edited in the Tables table dialog's
Accessibility toggles). When **no single table fits** the party, a **Combine
tables** section (`.core-bk-joins`/`.core-bk-join`, from `suggestJoins`) proposes
the fewest same-zone free tables that sum to the party; picking one seats the
primary and holds the rest together (`Reservation.joinedTableIds` — the seat
spine seats/frees every combined table as one, shown as "T5 + T6"). Then capture
the guest and confirm. The engine has these
live surfaces here: **(1) seat lifecycle** — Today's-bookings rows carry
**Seat / No-show / Complete** actions (`.bact`) that transition the reservation
and stamp `seatedAt`/`completedAt` (POST `/api/admin/floor/reservations`), so
Book answers "who's at T5?" — **seating also opens a dine-in POS tab** on the
table tagged with the guest (concept 5 phase 1; an empty one is cleared if the
party leaves without ordering), so the check is live where the party sits; **(2) walk-in guard** — a subbar **+ Walk-in**
button (`.core-bk-toolbtn.walk`) opens a `CoreDialog` that ranks tables at *now*
and only seats a genuinely-free one (writes a `source:"walk-in"` seated
reservation); **(3) manager policy** — a **⚙ Policy** `CoreDialog` with the
preset + weight sliders + numeric **rules** (`.core-bk-rules` — reset buffer,
pace cap, large-table seats, **section cap** per zone/15m, **reserved grace**
[keep a booked table held N min past its slot for a late guest] and **big-table
release** [only protect a large table while big demand is further than N min
away]), the **Guards**
toggles (`.core-bk-toggles`/`.core-bk-toggle` — **Protect large tables** hard-drops
a small party from a big top when a smaller one is free, **Auto-suggest**
pre-selects the engine pick, **Learn from overrides** logs every seat, **Shadow
mode** makes the engine advisory-only), a **VIP hold** zone picker
(`.core-bk-vipzones` — held zones exclude non-VIP parties), and a **Trust loop**
readout (`.core-bk-trust` — the agreement/override rate over logged seats, the
most common override **reason**, and a weight-tuning **nudge** `.core-bk-nudge`
when one signal is behind ≥40% of overrides), all persisted per location (GET/PUT
`/api/admin/seating/policy`, Rule #7); **(4) learned turn-times** — the engine
reads a model derived live from completed reservations' `seatedAt→completedAt`,
learned per **party × daypart × weekday-group** (weekday vs Fri/Sat) with a
confidence band, and a **predicted-vs-actual accuracy** readout
(`.core-bk-turnacc` — MAE, in-band %, and the bias direction, from
`summariseTurnAccuracy`) over the location's real closes (GET
`/api/admin/seating/turn-model` returns `{ cells, accuracy }`), cold-starting on
defaults;
**(5) trust loop** — every booked seat POSTs recommended-vs-chosen (+ the
override-**reason** chips `.core-bk-orsn` shown when the pick differs from the
recommendation, + the recommended pick's dominant signal) to
`/api/admin/seating/decisions` when Learn-from-overrides or Shadow mode is on, so
the override rate and the tuning nudge are measured numbers, not a guess.
**Today's bookings** (`.core-bk-blist`) is a
**full-width list below**, with cancel. A **lens toggle** in the section-head
right (the unified-header `.core-seg` view switch — `View` · timeline / floor /
arrivals) switches the surface between three views over **one shared
occupancy truth** — the **TableSession spine** (`src/lib/table-session.ts`,
`buildTableSessions`) — so they can never disagree: **Timeline** (the plan),
**Floor** (`.core-bk-floorlens` — a live table-tile grid built from the sessions:
`seated` tiles show the guest + elapsed with Complete **and open the table's POS
check** on tap (or the 🧾 Check button) as a docked embedded `CorePos` drawer
(`.core-check-overlay`/`.core-check-panel`, portaled to the `.core` root — the
same embedded till POS uses; the book **page** resolves
`menusByLocation`/`upsellByLocation` and passes them to `CoreBook`), `due`
bookings show "due" + Seat, `held` tiles show the next booking's countdown,
`free` tiles tap to seat a walk-in, and a table seated **off-book from POS**
renders as a dashed **`.offbook`** "occupied · walk-in" tile that also
opens its check), and **Arrivals** (`.core-bk-arrivals` — the host queue: **Expected
· Waitlist · Seated**). The **Waitlist** column (`.core-bk-wladd` add row +
`.apc.waitc` entries, backed by `/api/admin/floor/waitlist`) queues walk-ins with
a **live wait quote** from `estimateWaitMin` (soonest a fitting table frees, pushed
out by the parties ahead); an entry flips to "table ready" and **Seat** drops them
onto the engine's pick (a `walk-in` seated reservation) and closes them out of the
queue. `nowMin` is live client state (ticks every 30s) so Floor/Arrivals stay
current. **The spine is bidirectional**: seating/completing a
booking here fans out to `FloorTable.status` (via `reconcileFloorTable` in the
reservations route), so the `floor-twin` (shift handover + the POS table picker)
reflects it immediately; conversely a walk-in seated from POS shows in this
Floor lens as an off-book tile. `buildTableSessions` is pure (caller passes
`nowMin`) and unit-tested (`table-session.test.ts`). Timeline rows + the table-pick list read **`T{n}`, ordered by table
number** (shared with the Tables `tLabel`). The **surface toolbar**
(`.core-surf-toolbar.core-bk-subbar`, the ActionBar — under the command bar,
over the stat strip, via the shared `CoreSurfToolbar`) carries, in its `left`,
the **timeline / floor / arrivals** view switch, then the shared
**`CoreDateField`** picker (same as Slots); on the right the occasional
**Forecast · Policy** actions collapse behind a `⋯` `CoreActionMenu`, keeping
the frequent **Walk-in** button + the brand **New reservation** pill
(`.core-bk-newpill`, focuses the guest field) inline. A
**◔ Forecast** button opens a **pre-service simulation** `CoreDialog`
(`.core-bk-sim`, from `simulateService` via GET `/api/admin/seating/simulate`):
bookings/covers/peak-occupancy KPIs, a per-30-min table-occupancy bar chart
(`.core-bk-simchart`), and the **at-risk bookings** list (no table · too small ·
double-booked) so a manager sees pressure and un-seatable parties before doors
open. The engine also runs a **look-ahead** pass live: a table a *specific* known
later booking will need (a big party still to come that fits it tightly) is held
back from a smaller party now, with the reason *"needed for a 8 at 20:00"*.
Engine: `GET /api/admin/{slots,floor/tables,floor/reservations}`; create `POST
/api/admin/booking`; reassign/cancel via `POST` / `DELETE /api/admin/floor/reservations`.

**Dense-console parity** (`src/app/themes/core/parity/book.css`, imported after
base+skin; scoped under `.core`): the three cards (timeline · new-reservation
rail · today's-bookings list) are **frosted-glass** in the liquid-glass skin
(sheen + backdrop-blur + floating shadow), matching the mockup's `.glass` columns
and POS's frosted surfaces — see `../skins.md`. **Layout gutter:** `.core-book`
owns a single `14px` horizontal padding + a `10px` `column-gap`, and the stat
strip / divlabel / bookings list drop their own side margins inside Book — so
every row (header rows, the timeline↔form columns, and the list) shares one
left/right edge and the timeline/rail sit in a 10px channel (mockup `.main`
padding + `.book-grid` gap). Stat strip: Fill basil, Upcoming plain ink.

## Dispatch (`/core/service/dispatch`) — wired

- **Live code:** `src/core/service/CoreDispatch.tsx`; API
  `src/app/api/admin/dispatch/route.ts`; store helper `assignOrderDriver`
  (`src/lib/store.ts`).
- **Theme:** dense-console (mockup 06-service-dispatch): `.core-surf-toolbar`
  ActionBar (actions only) + `.core-statstrip`, then a `.core-disp-grid` (queue +
  drivers). The order cards stay token-styled inline; `.core-disp-drivers` /
  `.core-disp-driver` / `.core-disp-dstat` style the drivers panel.
- The delivery driver board. `GET /api/admin/dispatch?location=` returns the
  active delivery orders (`fulfillmentType==="delivery"`, status in
  confirmed→preparing→ready→assigned→picked_up, non-simulated) plus the
  location's **drivers** (staff whose role is in the `delivery` group —
  `driver`/`courier` — and `status==="active"`).
- A **6-up `.core-statstrip`** (in kitchen · ready · on road · delivered today
  · drivers · unassigned — all live, Rule #1) and a command-bar **⚡ Auto-assign
  nearest** action (assigns the earliest unassigned ready order to the first
  idle driver). Left column **Pass · delivery queue**: each card shows
  `#shortId`, address, items + total + customer, a status chip, and driver
  controls (unassigned → one-tap **assign chips**; assigned → driver +
  **Unassign**). Right column **Drivers** panel: each driver with a status
  derived live from the board — **en route** (a picked-up order) / **loading**
  (assigned, at pass) / **idle** — via `driverState`.
- Writes go through `PUT /api/admin/dispatch` — `{orderId, driverId}` calls
  `assignOrderDriver` (sets `Order.assignedDriverId`; the `assigned_driver_id`
  column + row mappers already existed) and `{orderId, status}` advances the
  lifecycle via the shared `updateOrderStatus` (assigned → picked_up →
  delivered). Both are audit-logged (`orders.assign_driver` /
  `orders.status_change`). The board polls every 8s. No parallel money/lifecycle
  state — it drives the same `Order`.

## Dense-console 1:1 parity pass (2026-07-02)

Parity layers: `src/app/themes/core/parity/{tables,slots,dispatch}.css` (imported after base+skin; scoped under `.core`). See `../redesign/PARITY-AUDIT.md`.

- **Tables** — stat strip Tables · Seats · Zones · Available · Out of service · Accessible (all derived live from the table catalogue); a `.core-seg` **Zone scope switch** in the ActionBar left plus **Add zone / Add table** on the right; tables grouped under first-class zone entities (drag to move, empty zones persist); tiles are `div[role=button]` that open the table editor on tap; `T`-prefixed numbers. `parity/tables.css` keeps only the tile cursor/focus ring + the zone-header hairline — the old `.core-tqa` quick-action row and `.core-floor-tools` lookup/recommender disclosure were dropped with the operational Floor board.
- **Slots** — leading `Manage|Demand` seg (brand-active) · Day/Week seg · the shared `CoreDateField` picker (left); on the right a `CoreFilterMenu` funnel (Fulfillment: All · Dine-in · Takeaway · Delivery) · standard `.core-iconbtn` Refresh · orange New-slot pill (`.core-slot-add`); stat cells 5–6 are Covers booked (info) + No-show risk (danger, flagged); default `.delta` basil/green; Manage tier chips fixed 46px.
- **Dispatch** — free-standing status-tinted order-pass cards (`.core-dcard .ready/.inkitchen/.road`) with itemized lines + inline assign/advance (no wrapping frame, no full-width advance button); driver roster gains an ETA column (`.core-roster-eta`); stat strip carries Avg delivery + Late; section sub `pass → road · {loc} · {clock}`; `delivery dispatch` subbar label. Drivers are seeded (delivery-role staff) so the roster populates.
