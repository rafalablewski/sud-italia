# Core · POS

The till. `/core/pos` — **and**, embedded, the Floor's check panel.

- **Live code:** `src/core/pos/CorePos.tsx` (client surface) +
  `src/app/core/pos/page.tsx` (server: resolves per-location menu
  snapshots and passes them in).
- **Embedded mode:** `<CorePos embedded initialTableId onClose>` renders the
  same check builder **without** the `CoreShell` chrome — a slim
  `.core-pos-embed-h` header (a `.core-pos-embed-back` back-arrow · table-forward
  title + party / item-count / running total · QR · Done) over the identical `posBody`
  (check-bar · rail · menu · check · all dialogs). The Floor mounts it in its
  docked check panel so "the check is never a separate place"; `initialTableId`
  opens/focuses that table's check on mount (the same path as the `?table=`
  deep-link). The standalone `/core/pos` surface renders the non-embedded branch
  (full `CoreShell`). One component, two mounts.
- **Theme:** `.core-pos` + `.core-rail` / `.core-cat` / `.core-menu` /
  `.core-prod` / `.core-ticket` in `themes/core/index.css`.

## Layout

A full-width **open-check bar** (`.core-checkbar`) over a three-column grid
inside the shell body: **rail · menu · ticket**.

- **`.core-checkbar`** — spans the whole width above the panes (so it sits
  over the menu's steering banner): an optional `.core-sync-pill`, then the
  `.core-tabrail-sum` rollup
  (`N tabs · R ready to pay · P parked · VALUE open`) over the wrapping
  `.core-tabrail` of `.core-ttab` open-check chips + `+ New`. The active check
  gets a brand outline; the rail wraps (capped height + scroll) so a busy
  till's checks stay browsable without a horizontal hunt. **`+ New` opens
  optimistically** — the check appears and goes active instantly under a
  client `tmp-` id, then reconciles to the server id when the background
  `POST` returns (carrying over anything rung in the meantime), so the till
  never blocks on a round-trip.
- **`.core-sync-pill`** — amber rounded status chip (`--amber` on
  `--amber-wash`), shown only when the durable write outbox
  (`src/store/writeQueue.ts`) holds unsent writes: `↻ N writes syncing`. It
  tells staff a send/charge made offline is saved and will land on
  reconnect — the visible end of the Phase 2b durable-queue path.

- **`.core-rail`** — the category rail. A **★ Popular** chip first when
  present (`.core-cat.pop`, ember fill, the default landing category) —
  frequency-ranked top items for the current daypart from
  `GET /api/admin/pos/popular` (real orders, Rule #1; hidden when empty) —
  then an **All** chip (stacks every
  category as `.core-menu-sec` blocks with `.core-menu-sec-h` headers) over
  the per-category `.core-cat` buttons — each lists only categories present
  on the active location's menu, with a live item count (`.n`) and, when
  steering is active, a `.core-cat-promise` per-category ETA (`~Nm` from
  `promiseSecondsByCategory`). `.on` = the selected category (filled ink).
- **`.core-menu` / `.core-menu-grid`** — auto-fill grid of `.core-prod` cards.
  Each card is **text-forward** (no photo dependency): `.pn` (display
  name, with a `.core-role` menu-engineering badge — Hero / Profit / Anchor
  / LTO from `menuRole`) · `.pd` (description, clamped to 2 lines) ·
  `.core-tagrow` of `.core-tag` chips (veg/vegan → `.veg`, spicy → `.hot`,
  gluten-free → `.fast`, plus an `.opt` **options** chip when the item has
  `modifierGroups`) plus a live `.core-steer-tag` pace cue (**★ make
  now** for `makeNow` ids, **▼ ease** for `throttle` ids) · `.pf` footer
  with the `.pp` mono price and the ember `.add` button (a `⋯` glyph when
  the item is customisable). Cards **stretch to equal height per row** and the `.pf`
  footer is pinned to the bottom (`margin-top: auto`), so a long
  description can't make one card taller than its row-mates. Tapping a plain
  card adds it straight to the check; a **customisable** card opens the line
  editor first (see *Line editor* below). A **sold-out** card
  (`.core-prod.sold-out` — base-unavailable OR live-86'd) is **not hidden**:
  it stays greyed + struck with a danger `.core-tag.off` "86 · sold out"
  chip, is disabled, and **sinks to the bottom** of its category (available
  first). The 86 set is polled live from `/api/admin/kds/eighty-six`, so an
  item 86'd on the pass greys on the till within one poll — no reload.
- **`.core-ticket`** — the open-check panel. Today it shows
  `.core-ticket-empty` (the no-open-check state).

## The ticket (open check)

Wired 1:1 to the shared server engine — fresh `core-`
UI, identical contract.

The open-check selector (`.core-tabrail-sum` + `.core-tabrail`) lives in the
top `.core-checkbar` (see Layout) — the `.core-ticket` column below shows the
**active** check only:

- **`.core-thead`** — `.core-th-name` (the check name is an **inline editable
  input** — click to rename, persisted via the same debounced `PUT`) ·
  channel/order tag · a `.core-tabpromise` per-check ETA (max
  `promiseSecondsByCategory` across the lines, toned by the bottleneck
  tier) · the `.core-covers` stepper (dine-in) and, right beside it, the
  `.core-chan-aux` button — **Assign table / Table N** (dine-in, opens the
  in-pane table picker) or **Add / Edit address** (delivery, opens the
  address dialog). Both sit next to the covers count so the seating /
  destination control lives with the party size. A `.core-delivery-paused`
  banner shows when steering has capped the next delivery window
  (`deliveryCapNextWindow === 0`).
- **`.core-chanrow` / `.core-chan`** — the channel selector (dine-in /
  takeaway / delivery), now just the three channel buttons.
- **`.core-timing` / `.core-seg`** — dine-in **kitchen-timing** toggle
  (Coursed ↔ All together); writes `tab.coursed`, which the `.core-lines`
  renderer reads to course or flat-list the ticket.
- **`.core-lines`** — `.core-line` rows. The row body is `.core-line-main`: a
  `.core-grip` handle (`⠿`) then a `.core-qstep` −/＋ counter, the **tappable
  line name** (`.ln-edit`, reveals a `✎` on hover → opens the line editor) and a
  mono line price (modifier deltas included). Under the name, `.core-line-mods`
  renders the chosen modifiers as `.core-mod-chip` chips (a `flagOnKds` pick →
  `.flag` amber) and the special-request note as `.core-mod-note` (amber `.alrg`
  when it names an allergy). **Line identity** is the item + its modifier picks +
  its note (`posLineKey`, `@/lib/pos-line`), so a plain item and a customised one
  sit on separate rows and the stepper / re-course / edit target the right line.
  Dine-in coursed checks group lines into `.core-course` blocks with a
  `.core-course-h` header and a per-course **Fire** button; fired courses dim
  (`.core-course.fired`) and show `✓ Fired`. **Re-coursing is touch-first:** on
  a coursed line the grip is a `<button>` that toggles `.core-line.picking`,
  revealing an inline `.core-recourse` chooser (`.core-recourse-opt` per course,
  current one `.on`) — one tap moves the line. Native drag stays as a
  mouse-only enhancement (`.core-line[draggable="true"]` shows the grab cursor +
  grip bob; dragging onto a course tints it via `.core-course.drop`). Flat
  (non-coursed) lines render the grip as an inert `<span>` and aren't
  draggable.
- **`.core-offer`** — cross-sell suggestions (`getCartSuggestions`), plus a
  `.core-offer.combo` **combo-completion** prompt when a deal is one or two
  items short (`getActiveComboDeals` → `missingItems` / `missingCategories`
  / `missingQuantity`); tapping it adds exactly the missing items so the
  real discount fires.
- **`.core-foot`** — an optional `.core-frow.member` chip (attached loyalty
  guest, with a remove ✕), `.core-frow` subtotal, `.core-frow.disc` combo
  discount **and** a `.core-frow.disc` manual-discount line, `.core-ftot` total,
  then `.core-foot-actions` (`.core-send` Send to KDS + `.core-charge`) and a
  -- each button carries an inline `.core-glyph` line-SVG (send · card ·
  park-bars · tag · person · trash, core's own glyphs, not lucide) --
  secondary `.core-foot-actions2` grid of `.core-foot-aux` buttons (`data-on`
  when active): **Park / hold** full-width (`.core-foot-aux-wide`; the park
  toggle now lives by Charge, not the top bar) over a 2-column row of
  **Add / Edit discount** | **Add membership / Member ✓**, then a
  full-width **Void check** (`.core-foot-aux.danger.core-foot-aux-wide`).
- **Discount + membership** — `DiscountDialog` (amount-zł or percent + an
  optional reason) and `MemberDialog` (phone + optional name) write
  `tab.discount` / `tab.customerPhone` + `tab.customerName` via the normal
  debounced tab PUT. The charged total is recomputed **server-side**
  (`buildOrderShape` → `manualDiscountGrosze`, the shared `@/lib/pos-discount`
  helper the footer preview also uses), and the member phone becomes the
  order's `customerPhone` (normalised) so loyalty points accrue on payment
  (Rule #6). Verified: a 10% discount on a 27.90 zł pizza charges 25.11 zł
  to `+48…`.
- **Void** — the footer's **Void check** button deletes the active open
  check (`DELETE /api/admin/pos/tabs?id=`). Optimistic: the row vanishes at
  once. An **empty** check is dropped on tap; a check with rung items
  confirms via a `CoreDialog` first (its danger button is
  `.core-btn.danger`). An unsaved optimistic (`tmp-`) check is removed locally
  only. The DELETE is **durable** — it goes through the same idempotent outbox
  as Send/Charge (`durableMutate`, `voidCheckOnServer` in `CorePos.tsx`), so a
  transient failure (5xx / dropped connection / cold-instance timeout) retries
  invisibly and survives a reload instead of resurfacing the voided check. The
  voided id is hidden from every incoming poll list (`voidedIds`) until the
  server confirms it gone; only a genuine 4xx (other than 404 = already gone)
  releases the guard and lets the next poll reconcile the check back. This is
  the fix for "voided checks reappear a few seconds later" — the bare
  fire-and-forget DELETE used to release the guard on any failure, so the 5s
  cross-till poll re-added the check the operator had just voided.

## Line editor (modifiers + special request)

`LineEditorDialog` (a `CoreDialog`, portaled) — opened from a customisable
product card or by tapping a line's name (`.ln-edit`). It builds the line's
`modifiers` + `notes` before they go on the check:

- **`.core-modgroup`** per `MenuItem.modifierGroups` group — a `.core-modgroup-h`
  header with a `.core-modgroup-rule` (required/optional · up-to-N) over a
  `.core-modopts` grid of `.core-modopt` toggles (`.on` when picked). Radio
  groups (`maxSelections ≤ 1`) replace; multi-select keeps up to `maxSelections`.
  A `flagOnKds` option shows a `★`; a positive `priceDelta` shows `+zł`.
  **Required** groups (`minSelections ≥ 1`) gate the Add button until satisfied.
- **`.core-notechips`** — quick note chips (`NOTE_CHIPS`) plus a special
  `.core-notechip.alrg` **⚠ Allergy** chip that prefixes the note; under them a
  `.core-textarea` (200-char cap). When the note matches the allergy regex a
  `.core-alrg-banner` warns it prints emphasised on the kitchen ticket.
- **`.core-editor-qty`** — a `.core-qstep.big` quantity stepper. The footer
  button reads **Add · zł** (or **Save · zł** when editing) with the live
  unit×qty total including modifier deltas.

The editor only ever writes the line shape (`menuItemId` + `modifiers` +
`notes` + `quantity`); **all pricing stays server-side** — `buildOrderShape`
re-resolves each pick against the live menu (`effectiveUnitPrice`), drops any
option id not on that item, and adds the menu's `priceDelta`. The KDS ticket
already renders `selectedModifiers` (`.mod` / `.mod.flag`) and the per-line
`notes`, so a customised line and its allergy flag reach the line cook unchanged.

## Tender sheet (tip · split · comp · cash change)

`TenderDialog` (a `CoreDialog`, portaled) replaces the old bare Card/Cash pad.
It composes the tender and PATCHes it as `{ tabId, tender }`:

- **Tip** — `.core-tchip` presets (None / 5 / 10 / 15 % of the net) + Custom zł.
- **Comp** — a `.core-tender-toggle` reveals reason-code chips (`COMP_REASONS`
  = **Quality · Wait · Goodwill · Error**) + an amount (defaults to the whole
  bill), over a **live per-shift comp-cap meter** (`.core-comp-cap` — fed by
  `GET /api/admin/pos/comp-status`: the actor's real audit-log comp total vs the
  `refundControls` cap). The bar turns danger + shows a 🔒 over-cap gate when the
  comp would breach; owners see a "caps don't apply" note. Recorded server-side
  as a single `manager_comp` (the chip is the note), so it shows in Reports and
  counts toward the cap (`getActorCompTotalToday`, audit action `pos.comp`).
- **Split** — `.core-tchip` presets (**Whole · ÷2 · ÷3 · ÷4 · By seat**, clamped
  to the cover count); each guest share is an equal slice (last absorbs the
  rounding remainder) with its own Cash/Card `.core-seg.sm` toggle. `Charge
  split` sends one `payments[]` entry per share. **By item** shows the check's
  lines (`.core-split-item` + per-line payer chips); each payer's amount is
  their assigned lines' weight × the actual total, so tip/comp distribute
  proportionally and the payments still sum to the charge.
- **Cash change** — choosing Cash on a single tender opens `.core-cashpad`:
  quick denomination chips + a free amount, a live `.core-change-row` change-due,
  and a Confirm gated until the cash covers the total.

**Every figure is server-authoritative** (`chargeTab`, `src/lib/pos/fireTab.ts`):
the bill comes from `buildOrderShape`; the comp is clamped to the bill and gated
by the shared `evaluateRefundGuard` (owners bypass, others hit the per-shift comp
cap); payments are validated to cover net due + tip or the charge 400s; cash
change is `tendered − cash share`. The tender lands on the `Order` as
`tipAmount` / `payments` / `compAmount` + `compReasonCode` + `compNote` /
`cashTendered` + `changeGiven`. A bare PATCH with no `tender` still charges the
full bill (the native `/api/v1` till is unchanged).

## Engine + API contract

Real, server-resolved; **no mock data** (Rule #1). The server owns the
total and the `orderId` — the till only ever sends item ids + quantities.

- `page.tsx` resolves `menusByLocation` (`getMenuWithOverrides`) +
  `upsellByLocation` (`getUpsellSettings`). The surface picks the menu for
  the `LocationContext` truck (shell chip), falling back to the first.
- **Tabs** — `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/admin/pos/tabs?location=`. `POST`
  opens a check (fired in the background behind the optimistic chip); local
  edits debounce 350ms to `PUT` (temp `tmp-` ids are never PUT — their edits
  flush once under the real id at reconcile); `DELETE` voids a check **durably**
  via `durableMutate` (see **Void** above). A
  visibility-aware 5s poll (`usePolling`) syncs other tills — skipped while an
  edit is mid-debounce **or** any save/open/void is still on the wire
  (`pendingSaves`, so an in-flight open or void can't be resurrected), and
  reconciled by `updatedAt` so an already-in-flight poll can't revert a
  fresher local edit.
- **Send / Fire** — `POST /api/admin/pos/orders` `{ tabId, courses? }`.
- **Charge** — `PATCH /api/admin/pos/orders` `{ tabId, tender? }` → applies the
  tender (tip / split / comp / cash), marks `paidAt`, returns the authoritative
  `{ totalAmount, tip, comp, change, netCollected }`, closes the tab. See
  *Tender sheet* below.
- **Pricing** — `getActiveComboDeals` (discount gated on `isComplete`,
  subtracted from the real total) + `getCartSuggestions`, both from
  `@/lib/upsell`; prices in grosze, formatted `27,90`.

## Own UI primitives

POS uses Core's **own** kit (no `src/ui`): `CoreDialog`
(`src/core/ui/Dialog.tsx`, the tender / address modals) and
`useCoreToast` (`src/core/ui/Toast.tsx`) — both portaled into the
`.core` theme root. Classes: `.core-scrim` / `.core-modal*` / `.core-btn` /
`.core-toast*`.

**Deep-link from the Floor** — `/core/pos?table=<id>&covers=<n>` (the Floor's
*Order →* link) is read once on mount: when the tables list has loaded the till
opens a **dine-in check pre-assigned to that table** (party as covers), or
focuses the existing open check for it instead of duplicating. The query is
stripped via `history.replaceState` so a refresh doesn't re-open a fresh check.

The **table picker** is **not** a modal — it takes over the middle (menu)
pane (`.core-tablepick`) for a full-size, **zone-grouped** board
(`.core-tablezone` → `.core-tablegrid.big` / `.core-tablebtn`) with a *← Back to
menu* return; switching checks closes it. Each table shows seats + zone
and flags conflicts with `.core-tbadge` chips — *In use* (another open
dine-in check is on it), *Seats N < party* (undersized), *Reserved*,
*Out of service* — and toasts a warning when you seat onto a conflicted/
over-capacity table.

## At parity

Pace-steering banner (`GET /api/admin/pace/steering`), park/resume,
tap- or drag-to-recourse (tap a line's grip for the inline course chooser,
or drop a line on a course header), kitchen-timing toggle,
inline check rename, optimistic check open + void/delete, double-seat /
over-capacity guards, the tab-rail rollup, a hydration-aware empty state,
and the fullscreen kiosk are all wired — feature-for-feature with today's
`/core/pos`.

## QR table-order queue

Live code: `src/core/pos/CoreQrQueue.tsx` · API `src/app/api/admin/pos/qr-orders/route.ts`.

A **QR pill** in the POS sub-header (`subRight`, beside the channel chip +
Park) surfaces the dine-in orders guests placed by scanning a table QR
(`channel: "qr"`, from `/qr`). It polls `GET /api/admin/pos/qr-orders?location=`
every 8s; the pill goes `on` and shows an "N to pay" count when any are
unpaid. Opening it lists each order in a `CoreDialog` — table number,
guest, party size, line items, elapsed time, total and a paid/unpaid·status
chip. **Take payment** expands an inline `QrTenderPanel` (`.core-qr-tender`) —
method (Card/Cash), tip presets, and a cash change-due — and **Settle** posts
`{ orderId, action: "settle", tender }`. The route applies the tender to the
**existing** order (no duplicate order/tab, so no double-charge): it sets
`paidAt`, fires a still-pending demo-mode order to the kitchen (status →
`confirmed`), and writes the same `tipAmount` / `payments` / `cashTendered` +
`changeGiven` fields the POS tender uses, so a guest order settles through the
same money model as a server-rung check. A bare settle (no `tender`) still just
marks it paid. The order stays the single source of truth — totals owned
server-side.

The same dialog's **Print table QR** tab generates a printable per-table QR
(an SVG from `GET /api/admin/qr-code?location=&table=&base=`, encoding
`<origin>/qr?location=&table=`) and opens a clean print window — so staff
can produce the codes guests scan, closing the QR loop.
